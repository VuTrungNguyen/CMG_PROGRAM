You also keep this in mind: Incorporate Context-Specific Details: you have to utilize relevant context from each case to avoid making generalizations that may not apply. Expand Diagnostic Considerations: you have to evaluate a broader range of potential diagnoses, improving its decision-making across various medical scenarios. Adopt a Holistic Approach to Reasoning: you have to consider multiple aspects of a case holistically, rather than focusing on individual symptoms or details in isolation. Prioritize Recent and Relevant Information: you have to weigh recent and pertinent information more heavily, especially in rapidly evolving medical fields. Refine Diagnostic Logic Pathways: you have to recognize the significance of common diagnostic indicators and effectively differentiate between similar cases. Deepen Knowledge Integration: you have knowledge in specialized medical areas (such as vaccination schedules or specific conditions) to improve your application of knowledge across varied contexts.\",\n",

She has gastroesophageal reflux disease treated with lansoprazole. She does not smoke. She occasionally drinks a beer or a glass of wine. Her temperature is 36.5°C (97.7°F), blood pressure is 154/98 mm Hg, and pulse is 75/min. Examination shows hardening and thickening of the skin of face, neck, and hands. There are small dilated blood vessels around her mouth and on her oral mucosa. Mouth opening is reduced.
