Performance of a high-quality colonoscopy examination requires understanding and mastery of cognitive and technical skills. A joint American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy/American College of Gastroenterology Taskforce on Quality in Endoscopy advocated the following quality indicators before, during, and after colonoscopy [1,2] (see 'Quality indicators' below):\n\u25cf\nPreprocedure \u2013 Attention must be paid to the general issues of timely scheduling, appropriate patient preparation, targeted history and physical examination, evaluation of bleeding risk, assessment for appropriate sedation, and team pause before commencing sedation. It is also important to understand appropriate indications and recommended surveillance intervals based upon the patient's risk factors (eg, family history of colorectal cancer, prior adenomatous polyps, hereditary colon cancer syndrome, or inflammatory bowel disease). Finally, obtaining informed consent with a detailed explanation of the risks associated with colonoscopy is essential.\n\u25cf\nIntraprocedure \u2013 Performing a high-quality examination requires careful visualization of the entire colonic mucosa. Metrics such as cecal intubation rates, withdrawal times, and adenoma detection rates serve as surrogate, though imperfect, markers of careful visualization. In addition, a high-quality examination requires appropriate tissue acquisition (eg, surveillance biopsies in inflammatory bowel disease) and endoscopic removal of all polyps less than 2 cm. Removal of polyps larger than 2 cm may require special endoscopic skills.\n\u25cf\nPostprocedure \u2013 There must be immediate, complete, and accurate documentation (both written and photographic) of preparation quality and findings, as well as explicit recommendations for follow-up. Tissue samples taken during colonoscopy must be documented. Pathology results should be reviewed with results and recommendations communicated to the patient and referring providers. Finally, there should be a system for tracking adverse events.\nThis topic will review factors associated with performing a colonoscopy including indications, patient preparation, technical aspects, and adverse events. Issues related to colon cancer screening recommendations, bowel preparations for colonoscopy, procedural sedation, and the management of antiplatelet or anticoagulant medications in patients undergoing endoscopy are discussed separately.

Screening is intended for patients without signs or symptoms of possible CRC.\nCRC epidemiology, including incidence, mortality rates, and variability by sex, age, and portion of the colon, is described in detail separately. (See \"Epidemiology and risk factors for colorectal cancer\", section on 'Epidemiology'.)\nRecommendations for patients at increased risk are described in detail separately:\n\u25cf\n(See \"Screening for colorectal cancer in patients with a family history of colorectal cancer or advanced polyp\".)\n\u25cf\n(See \"Familial adenomatous polyposis: Screening and management of patients and families\".)\n\u25cf\n(See \"Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer): Cancer screening and management\", section on 'Colorectal cancer'.)\n\u25cf\n(See \"Juvenile polyposis syndrome\", section on 'Screening and management'.)\n\u25cf\n(See \"Medical management of low-risk adult patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis\", section on 'Other therapies'.)\n\u25cf\n(See \"Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and prognosis of ulcerative colitis in adults\".)\n\u25cf\n(See \"Peutz-Jeghers syndrome: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management\", section on 'Gastrointestinal cancer'.)\n\u25cf\n(See \"MUTYH-associated polyposis\", section on 'Colorectal cancer surveillance'.)\nFor patients with colon polyps that require follow-up surveillance for CRC, recommendations are described separately. (See \"Overview of colon polyps\".)\nSCREENING RATIONALE\nNatural history of colorectal cancer and colon polyps \u2014 Most colorectal cancers (CRC) arise from adenomatous colon polyps that progress from small (<8 mm) to large (\u22658 mm) polyps, then to dysplasia and carcinoma. Adenomatous polyps occur in about 30 percent of men and about 20 percent of women. A colon polyp must be biopsied to determine its pathology, because gross appearance does not reliably distinguish adenomatous polyps from hyperplastic polyps, which are typically not precancerous.\nProgression from adenoma to carcinoma is believed to take an average of approximately 10 years [1]. This estimate is imprecise and may not apply to all types of polyps. The clinical presentation and natural history of colon polyps are described in detail separately. (See \"Overview of colon polyps\".)\nBenefits of screening \u2014 We recommend that average-risk patients over the age 45 years be screened for CRC. CRC incidence and mortality rates have been declining in the United States, likely due to an increase in screening [2-4]. (See \"Epidemiology and risk factors for colorectal cancer\", section on 'Epidemiology'.)\nScreening tests for CRC can improve disease prognosis by identifying early-stage CRC that is easier to treat and has a lower mortality rate than CRC detected after symptoms develop. In addition, screening can prevent CRC by detecting and removing premalignant polyps before they progress to CRC.\nAcross the multiple strategies that are recommended for screening by major guidelines, the numbers of CRC deaths averted appear to be relatively similar, although sensitivity and specificity for detection of polyps and of CRC vary, as shown in a figure (figure 1). A mortality benefit has been demonstrated in randomized clinical trials for guaiac-based fecal occult blood testing (gFOBT) and sigmoidoscopy and is inferred for other screening tests based on observational studies and indirect comparison with studies of other screening strategies that have undergone randomized controlled trials. The types of evidence supporting efficacy of each CRC screening strategy are discussed in detail separately. (See \"Tests for screening for colorectal cancer\".)\nHarms associated with screening \u2014 Most of the harms of screening for CRC are related to the risks from colonoscopy, including perforation. Any abnormal results of initial screening tests other than colonoscopy (eg, stool test, virtual colonoscopy) necessitate a colonoscopy to evaluate the abnormality; thus, all screening modalities are associated with the potential for colonoscopy-associated complications [5,6]. In a meta-analysis of over 335,000 individuals screened initially by either FOBT or sigmoidoscopy with positive results followed up with colonoscopy, a major complication was recorded in 0.08 percent of participants, including 0.03 percent who initiated screening with FOBT [7]. In older adults, colonoscopy carries increased risk of complications. Complications of colonoscopy are described in detail separately. (See \"Overview of colonoscopy in adults\", section on 'Adverse events'.)\nCost and cost effectiveness \u2014 The cost of the various screening tests for CRC varies over a wide range, from a few US dollars for gFOBT to USD $1000 or more for colonoscopy. Models regarding the cost-effectiveness (cost per year of life saved) of CRC screening come to somewhat different conclusions because they make different assumptions. The cost per year of life saved is within the generally accepted range in the United States (USD $50,000), relative to no screening, for all of the recommended CRC screening tests [8]. For example, in one analysis the cost per year of life saved was USD <$15,000 for all recommended tests, compared with no screening [9].\nASSESSING RISK FOR COLORECTAL CANCER\nThe first step in screening is identifying the patient\u2019s level of risk for colorectal cancer (CRC) because level of risk impacts screening and follow-up recommendations. For this purpose, patients are generally determined to be either at average risk or at increased risk.\nWe assess the risk for CRC at the initial visit for an adult who is age 20 years or older, unless a genetic risk is already known and documented, to identify high-risk patients who should begin CRC screening at an earlier age than those at average risk. Subsequent reassessment every three to five years identifies whether the patient or their biologic family members have developed factors that raise the patient\u2019s level of risk for CRC. Although there are no published guidelines supporting this approach, one study from a United States national population-based cancer registry found that the number of patients who would meet criteria for high-risk screening based on family history significantly increased from age 30 (2.1 percent) to age 50 (7.1 percent), supporting the need to update the family history [10].\nFactors important to determine increased CRC risk can be assessed by asking several questions. A \"no\" response to all of these questions generally indicates average risk.\n\u25cf\nHave you ever had CRC or an adenomatous polyp? A personal history of CRC increases the risk of another primary (metachronous) cancer. Surveillance following CRC is discussed separately. (See \"Post-treatment surveillance for colorectal cancer\", section on 'Diagnosing second cancers and polyps'.)\nA personal history of adenomatous colorectal polyps increases the risk of CRC [11]. The number and types of polyp lesions guide the determination of the appropriate interval for surveillance. Recommendations for follow-up are described separately. (See \"Overview of colon polyps\", section on 'Surveillance'.)\nIf the patient\u2019s personal polyp history is uncertain, records should be obtained to determine if the patient had an adenomatous polyp. If records cannot be obtained, the patient may recall being told a polyp was found and advised to have a follow-up colonoscopy in five years or sooner, suggesting the polyp was adenomatous.\n\u25cf\nHave any biologic family members had CRC or a documented advanced polyp? An advanced polyp is defined as an advanced adenoma (adenoma \u22651 cm, or with high-grade dysplasia, or adenoma with tubulovillous or villous histology [12]) or advanced serrated lesion (sessile serrated polyp [SSP] \u22651 cm, or traditional serrated adenoma \u22651 cm, or SSP with cytologic dysplasia).\nIf so, how many biologic family members, were they first-degree relatives (parent, sibling, or child), and at what age was the cancer or polyp first diagnosed? Enhanced screening is warranted for a patient with increased risk of CRC due to a family history of CRC or documented advanced polyp and is described in detail separately. (See \"Screening for colorectal cancer in patients with a family history of colorectal cancer or advanced polyp\".)\nIf a biologic family member is reported to have had a polyp but there is lack of available documentation about the type of polyp, the patient is typically screened as if a family member did not have an advanced polyp. (See \"Screening for colorectal cancer in patients with a family history of colorectal cancer or advanced polyp\", section on 'Assessing risk due to family history'.)\nIf the patient cannot obtain any family history whatsoever related to colorectal cancer or polyps, some experts suggest screening the patient as average risk, although no studies have evaluated that approach.\n\u25cf\nDo you have biologic family members with any of the known genetic syndromes that can cause CRC? Patients with a family history of a known genetic syndrome for CRC may require enhanced screening plus genetic counseling. These syndromes and associated screening recommendations are discussed in detail separately:\n\u2022\n(See \"Familial adenomatous polyposis: Screening and management of patients and families\".)\n\u2022\n(See \"Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer): Cancer screening and management\", section on 'Colorectal cancer'.)\n\u2022\n(See \"Juvenile polyposis syndrome\", section on 'Screening and management'.)\n\u2022\n(See \"Peutz-Jeghers syndrome: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management\", section on 'Gastrointestinal cancers'.)\n\u2022\n(See \"MUTYH-associated polyposis\", section on 'Colorectal cancer surveillance'.)\n\u25cf\nDo you have inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis or Crohn disease)? Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) of the colon (ulcerative colitis or Crohn disease) have an increased risk of CRC. The approach to surveillance for CRC in patients with IBD is discussed separately. (See \"Surveillance and management of dysplasia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease\", section on 'Approach to surveillance'.)\n\u25cf\nDid you receive abdominal radiation for childhood cancer? Adults who received abdominal radiation in childhood for malignancy are at increased risk of CRC. Enhanced screening recommendations are described separately. (See \"Epidemiology and risk factors for colorectal cancer\", section on 'Abdominopelvic radiation'.)\nOther risk factors that may influence screening advice include:\n\u25cf\nHIV infection in men \u2013 For male patients who are living with HIV, the risk for cancer in the colon seems to be similar to the general population risk, so screening strategies for CRC should be based on other risk factors the patient has [13].\nMale patients with HIV have an increased risk for anal neoplasia (though not for colon cancer) compared with the general population. Specific screening recommendations for anal cancer are described separately. (See \"Anal squamous intraepithelial lesions: Epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, screening, prevention, and treatment\", section on 'Screening for anal SIL'.)\n\u25cf\nAdditional risk factors for CRC, including lifestyle matters (eg, dietary factors, obesity, alcohol use, smoking) that may impact CRC risk, are discussed in detail separately. (See \"Epidemiology and risk factors for colorectal cancer\", section on 'Factors that may influence screening recommendations'.)\nA detailed discussion of risk factors for CRC is presented separately. (See \"Epidemiology and risk factors for colorectal cancer\".)\nSOCIAL FACTORS AND HEALTH EQUITY\nIn the United States, incidence rates and mortality for colorectal cancer (CRC) are higher among Native American/Alaskan Native, Native Hawaiian, other Pacific Islander, and Black people, particularly Black males, than among those in other racial or ethnic groups [14]. CRC incidence is also disproportionately high in geographic locations such as the Mississippi Delta region and the Appalachian region that are correlated with socioeconomic disadvantage [15,16]. Disparities in incidence and mortality among Black people are apparent even prior to the age recommended for initiating screening in people at average risk for CRC.\nSeveral factors have been shown to contribute to disparities, including disproportionate rates of exposure to risk factors, historical social injustices, and barriers to access to screening and other preventive services. Disparities have also been documented in the quality of screening and care received, such as delays in initiation of treatment [17]. A report by the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) found an extensive body of literature on implementation strategies for delivering preventive care services, including CRC screening [18,19]. The USPSTF encouraged development of delivery services to ensure equitable access to high-quality care from screening through treatment, particularly for people from groups that experience disproportionate incidence, late-stage diagnosis, and death from CRC. Studies in the state of Delaware and in Kaiser Permanente, Northern California have shown that system-based coordinated strategies for equitable delivery of screening and follow-up care while addressing structural barriers, including patient navigation and reminder systems, can reduce or even eliminate disparities [20,21]. (See \"Epidemiology and risk factors for colorectal cancer\", section on 'Race and sex'.)\nAGE TO INITIATE SCREENING\nWe initiate screening at age 45 years in adults at average risk consistent with US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendations. Colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence is generally higher with increasing age (figure 2). Although most cases of CRC occur over age 50 years, initiating screening at age 45 years balances the benefits of detection and prevention with the burden on the patient and the risk of harms from screening [22]. (See 'Benefits of screening' above.)\n\u25cf\nThe USPSTF recommends initiating screening at age 45 (Grade B) while maintaining its strongest recommendation (Grade A) for initiating at age 50 [22].\n\u25cf\nThe American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) 2021 guidelines also recommend initiating screening at age 45 in all adults at average risk [23].\n\u25cf\nInitiating screening at age 45 years is a \u201cqualified\u201d recommendation from the American Cancer Society (ACS); this accompanies its strong recommendation to screen at age 50 or older [5,24]. The ACS noted that data to support starting at age 45 years are limited; the rationale is supported from some but not all modeling analyses [25].\n\u25cf\nInitiating screening at age 50 years for average-risk adults is recommended by the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care (CTFPHC), the European Council, the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), and the American College of Physicians (ACP) [26-29].\nDISCONTINUING SCREENING\nThe decision about when to discontinue screening should be individualized based on shared decision-making, taking into account the patient\u2019s risk for colorectal cancer (CRC), prior screening history, personal values, and whether the patient's comorbid conditions and life expectancy justify the risks of continued screening [30-33].\nWe continue to screen for CRC through age 75 years for average-risk patients, as long as their life expectancy is 10 years or greater. Screening at least until age 75 years for patients at average risk for CRC is recommended by the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) and many other guidelines [5,22,26-29,34]. This is based on the increasing frequency of CRC with age and the time course of progression from polyp to CRC.\nFor older adults who have never been screened, results of a modeling study suggest that one-time screening appears to be cost-effective up to an age that varies depending on the patient\u2019s life expectancy, comorbidities, and the test used for screening [35]. As an example, for patients at average risk for CRC and without any comorbidities, in the simulation study, assuming a willingness to pay USD $100,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained, colonoscopy was cost-effective to age 83 years, sigmoidoscopy to 84 years, and fecal immunochemistry testing (FIT) to 86 years. In that study, colonoscopy was the most effective, due to its overall effectiveness for both CRC and adenomas, and was also the most expensive strategy for one-time screening.\nFor patients aged 76 to 85 years who have been screened before, we individualize the decision about whether to continue screening, based on factors including the patient\u2019s preferences, prior testing results, and comorbidities. Some guidelines recommend not continuing screening, whereas others recommend that the decision to screen adults 76 to 85 years be individualized, taking into account the patient\u2019s overall health and prior screening history [5,22,26,34,36,37]. Data supporting continued screening are limited; trials have included too few older patients to provide reliable evidence-based guidance about the balance of benefits and harms of screening beyond age 75 years. A prospective observational study of Medicare beneficiaries found that undergoing colonoscopy modestly decreased the risk of developing CRC over an eight-year period for those aged 70 to 74 years (2.2 versus 2.6 percent in the no-screening group), with a non-significant decrease in risk for those 75 to 79 years. In a modeling study of adults aged 65 years at average risk for CRC with average life expectancy and negative colonoscopy at age 55, extending screening beyond age 75 resulted in net harm (loss of quality-adjusted life-years) due to complications from colonoscopy.\nShortened life expectancy modifies these age guidelines. Patients with a life expectancy less than 10 years (some would say five years) would not be expected to benefit from colorectal screening, since studies indicate benefit from screening in a population starts to accrue after about five years. For example, in a meta-analysis of screening with sigmoidoscopy, an absolute risk reduction of one CRC-related death for every 5000 sigmoidoscopies was observed at 4.3 years, and an absolute risk reduction of one CRC-related death for every 1000 sigmoidoscopies occurred by 9.4 years [38]. In one modeling study, screening patients ages 67 to 69 with three or more comorbidities would save fewer lives than screening older patients (ages 75 to 79) with no comorbidity (81 versus 459 lives saved per 100,000) [39]. Some guidelines recommend stopping screening for CRC when the patient's life expectancy is less than 10 years [34].\nCHOOSING A SCREENING TEST\nRecommended tests are either based on stool testing or visualization of the colon endoscopically or radiographically. Characteristics and effectiveness of testing strategies available as options for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening are discussed in more detail separately. (See \"Tests for screening for colorectal cancer\".)\nA 2019 guidance statement from the American College of Physicians provides a summary and an appraisal of various guidelines on colorectal cancer screening as well as information on recommended screening tests [40].\nAdvising patients about screening \u2014 After determining a patient is at average risk for CRC, we use motivational interviewing and shared-decision making techniques to assess patient preferences and recommend screening. (See 'Assessing risk for colorectal cancer' above.)\nDuring shared decision-making about CRC screening, individual patient preferences, values, and risk, as well as test effectiveness, resource availability, test safety, convenience, comfort, and cost, are factors in determining which screening test among those recommended by guidelines groups is preferred by a specific patient. Characteristics and effectiveness of tests available as options for CRC screening are summarized in a table and are discussed in more detail separately. (See \"Tests for screening for colorectal cancer\".)\nThe best screening test is one that the patient is willing to complete according to the test instructions [41]. The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) and the American Cancer Society (ACS) note that being screened with a test acceptable to the patient is preferable to having the patient decline screening because of not being given options of screening tests [5,41].\nPatient preferences among screening tests were evaluated in randomized trials that found participation rates for patients assigned to screening with FIT were greater than with stool guaiac, sigmoidoscopy, or colonoscopy [42,43]. This suggests greater preference for convenience and ease of testing without the need for dietary restrictions or multiple stool samples. However, findings from these studies represent the average preference for groups of patients and should not be applied without assessing individual preferences.\nNoninvasive screening tests such as FIT and multitarget stool deoxyribonucleic acid testing (MT-sDNA) can be mailed directly to patients to be completed in the comfort of their homes.\nPreferred tests \u2014 In our practice, we prioritize the following screening tests (as noted, other authorities and guidelines may make somewhat different recommendations):\n\u25cf\nColonoscopy \u2013 We advise colonoscopy every 10 years for most patients at average risk for CRC who are willing to undergo this procedure. Screening with colonoscopy is associated with reduced incidence and mortality from CRC. Among screening tests, colonoscopy has the highest sensitivity for CRC and adenomatous polyps (figure 1) and allows lesion removal anywhere in the colon during just one procedure with the potential to detect as well as prevent cancer by removing adenomatous polyps prior to malignant transformation. (See \"Tests for screening for colorectal cancer\", section on 'Colonoscopy'.)\nThe frequency of follow-up for patients with findings on a colonoscopy is described separately. (See \"Overview of colon polyps\", section on 'Surveillance'.)\nWhen an adequate screening colonoscopy is accomplished, intercurrent stool tests (ie, between colonoscopy examinations) are not necessary. In addition, for patients who have had a negative colonoscopy and have been recommended to have routine screening in 10 years, screening with FIT or other screening tests is not indicated prior to the end of the 10-year period.\nColonoscopy is recommended as a screening option by many expert groups, including the USPSTF, ACS, National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), and American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), and is in the most highly recommended tier of tests according to the US Multisociety Task Force on Colorectal Cancer (MSTF) [5,28,44-47]. It is a suggested alternative in the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guideline and by the American College of Physicians (ACP) [29,48,49]. However, the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care (CTFPHC) does not recommend using colonoscopy as a primary screening test [26].\n\u25cf\nFecal immunochemical testing \u2013 We advise screening with FIT for occult blood annually on a single sample as an option for screening. We recommend FIT for screening for patients unable or unwilling to have a colonoscopy as initial screening, or when access to colonoscopy is limited, with the understanding that if the FIT result is positive, colonoscopy needs to be performed promptly. Compared with colonoscopy, FIT has similar detection rates for CRC but lower detection rates for advanced adenomas. However, compared with fecal occult blood testing (FOBT), FIT has greater sensitivity without loss of specificity as well as better detection of advanced adenomas [46,50-52]. (See \"Tests for screening for colorectal cancer\", section on 'Fecal immunochemical test (FIT) for blood'.)\nFIT is recommended as a screening option according to many expert groups. Annual testing with FIT is one of several options recommended by the USPSTF, which does not endorse test preferences [46]. We recommend using a quantitative FIT with automated high throughput analysis as the fecal test of choice for CRC screening, as recommended by the a European consensus panel [53]. In the United States, the MSTF recommends FIT as one of the first-tier (most highly recommended) choices [44]. ACP, ACS, AAFP, and ASCO include FIT as a screening option [5,28,29,48,49] and NCCN suggests it as an alternative test [45].\n\u25cf\nMultitarget stool DNA testing \u2013 MT-sDNA, also known as FIT-DNA and multitarget fecal DNA, combines fecal testing for hemoglobin and DNA mutation and methylation. It is available as Cologuard in the United States. The test is performed every three years on one stool collection sample, but the USPSTF recommends use of MT-sDNA every one to three years. (See \"Tests for screening for colorectal cancer\", section on 'Multitarget stool DNA tests with fecal immunochemical testing'.)\nMT-sDNA testing has a higher single-application sensitivity and a lower specificity than FIT for CRC and advanced precancerous lesions [54], and it is more expensive than FIT.\nMT-sDNA testing is included as a second-tier choice by MSTF and is also recommended by the ACS, NCCN, and USPSTF [5,44,55].\n\u25cf\nComputed tomography colonography \u2013 We advise computed tomography colonography (CTC, formerly referred to as \u201cvirtual colonoscopy\u201d) as another option. CTC is performed every five years. CTC is more sensitive than any test other than colonoscopy to detect adenomatous polyps, although data are limited on other outcomes. Patients should understand that if CTC findings suggest polyps or CRC, colonoscopy is required promptly for evaluation. (See \"Tests for screening for colorectal cancer\", section on 'Computed tomography colonography'.)\nFor older patients with comorbidities (eg, cardiopulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, or history of stroke), CTC might be preferred over colonoscopy, because the risks of colonoscopy increase with age [56]. However, patients with abnormal findings on CTC should undergo colonoscopy. Therefore, patients who choose CTC should also be candidates for colonoscopy.\nCTC requires either a bowel preparation or oral ingestion of a preparation to tag stool so it can be electronically \u201cremoved\u201d from the radiographic images. CTC exposes the patient to some abdominal radiation, and may identify incidental abdominal findings that need follow-up to determine if they are of clinical significance. Detection of incidental extra-colonic findings also rises with increasing age, which can lead to testing and procedures that carry risks. The preparation, technique, and risks of CTC are described separately. (See \"Overview of computed tomographic colonography\".)\nCTC is recommended as a second-tier option by MSTF, a suggested alternative by ASCO, and recommended by ACS [5,44,48,49]. NCCN did not come to consensus about CTC for screening [45].\nOther tests used \u2014 Other testing strategies appropriate for average risk patients include the following:\n\u25cf\nSigmoidoscopy combined with FIT (or high-sensitivity gFOBT) \u2013 The combination of sigmoidoscopy with FIT or guaiac-based FOBT (gFOBT) theoretically enhances lesion detection by offering direct visualization up to 60 cm as well as by detecting colon lesions beyond the reach of a sigmoidoscope by testing for occult blood. FIT is preferred over sensitive gFOBT. (See \"Tests for screening for colorectal cancer\", section on 'Sigmoidoscopy plus FIT or gFOBT'.)\nThe recommended frequencies of each test vary among expert guidelines. USPSTF recommends sigmoidoscopy every 10 years with annual FIT, which is also an option in ASCO guidelines [22,48,49]. NCCN includes an option for sigmoidoscopy every five years with annual FOBT [45]. ACP includes sigmoidoscopy every 10 years plus combined FIT every two years [29]. However, the evidence for this strategy is limited.\n\u25cf\nSigmoidoscopy alone \u2013 If the option of adding a stool-based test is not available or practical for a patient to do in conjunction with sigmoidoscopy, then screening with sigmoidoscopy alone every 5 to 10 years may be offered.\nSigmoidoscopy can be performed with minimal patient preparation and does not require sedation. However, a sigmoidoscopy can only identify lesions up to the distal 60 cm of the bowel. This may be problematic in women and older patients because they have a higher frequency of more proximal lesions. (See \"Epidemiology and risk factors for colorectal cancer\", section on 'Incidence' and \"Tests for screening for colorectal cancer\", section on 'Sigmoidoscopy'.)\nRecommendations for how often to perform screening with sigmoidoscopy alone vary among guidelines. Sigmoidoscopy every five years is a screening option recommended by the USPSTF and other groups [5,22,48,49]. MSTF includes it as an option to be performed every 5 to 10 years, and CTFPHC includes sigmoidoscopy every 10 years [26,44].\n\u25cf\nGuaiac-based fecal occult blood test \u2013 If this method is chosen, the sensitive gFOBT (eg, Hemoccult SENSA) should be used. gFOBT is done annually on three samples as a take-home test that the patient mails back, rather than on stool obtained during a digital rectal examination (DRE). Stool obtained by DRE should not be used for CRC screening.\nSome clinicians advise dietary restrictions during testing, though these restrictions may limit patient adherence to testing and thus some clinicians no longer restrict diet during testing. It typically takes at least three days to complete the testing due to the number of samples needed; however, bowel preparation and sedation are not needed.\nStool guaiac tests (gFOBT) have low sensitivity for polyps and relatively low specificity for clinically important disease. Additionally, gFOBT needs to be repeated annually if negative. (See \"Tests for screening for colorectal cancer\", section on 'Guaiac-based fecal occult blood test (gFOBT)'.)\ngFOBT is included by the ACS, ASCO, and NCCN as an option to be done yearly, and by the ACP and CTHPHC to be done every two years; it was the only screening test recommended by the European Council in 2012 [5,26,27,45,48,49].\n\u25cf\nCapsule colonoscopy \u2013 Capsule colonoscopy every five years is included in the MSTF guideline as a third-tier option, although it is not among the tests included in some screening guidelines [44]. In this test, the patient swallows a capsule containing tiny video cameras. A stool preparation is needed; however, sedation is not needed. In the United States, this test is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a standalone screening method for CRC, but it is approved as an option for patients who had an incomplete colonoscopy. (See \"Tests for screening for colorectal cancer\", section on 'Colon capsule endoscopy' and \"Wireless video capsule endoscopy\", section on 'Colon capsule endoscopy'.)\nTests that are less effective or lack sufficient evidence on effectiveness \u2014 Certain tests, including some used previously, are not suggested for screening because they have lower accuracy than those that are recommended.\nAn assay (Epi proColon 2.0) to detect septin 9 DNA, which is hypermethylated in CRC but not in normal colon tissue, is approved by the FDA as an aid for CRC detection in average-risk patients who were refuse screening by more sensitive guideline-recommended method, but it is not currently recommended by the USPSTF. Its sensitivity for CRC (75 percent) in people who selected based on their disease status and a lack of evidence on effectiveness on mortality outcomes make it inadequate as a primary screening strategy. (See \"Tests for screening for colorectal cancer\", section on 'Other blood-based markers'.)\nTests no longer recommended include DRE, office-based gFOBT after DRE, and barium enema (single- or double-contrast [DCBE]) [57].\nCarcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), a tumor marker that may be used for surveillance of patients with CRC, is not a useful screening test for CRC. (See \"Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and staging of colorectal cancer\", section on 'Tumor markers'.)\nVarious technologies such as plasma-based assay of circulating cell-free DNA from tumors are being developed with the goal of detecting multiple types of cancers using a single test (aka multicancer early detection). However, these tests have not been studied in unselected populations and are not recommended by the USPSTF [58].\nResource-limited settings \u2014 An ASCO guideline, developed by a multinational panel, stratifies recommended and alternative CRC screening tests for average-risk patients aged 50 to 75 according to availability of clinical resources in the patient\u2019s setting [48,49].\n\u25cf\nIn a basic setting, highly sensitive gFOBT is recommended every one (preferred) to two years, with FIT as a suggested alternative every one (preferred) to two years.\n\u25cf\nIn a limited setting with more resources, recommended tests include highly sensitive gFOBT yearly or sigmoidoscopy every five years with suggested alternatives of FIT yearly or sigmoidoscopy every 10 years plus yearly FIT (preferred) or yearly FOBT.\nFOLLOW-UP OF ABNORMAL RESULTS\nScreening should be supported by a program that assures prompt follow-up of abnormal findings as well as ongoing screening. Patients with an incomplete screening test that did not demonstrate an abnormal finding should have the screening test repeated; this is described separately. (See \"Tests for screening for colorectal cancer\", section on 'Follow-up of inadequate testing'.)\nA patient with any positive (ie, abnormal) screening test for colorectal cancer (CRC) other than colonoscopy itself requires a timely colonoscopy to evaluate for colon polyps and CRC [5,6]. If a stool-based test (fecal immunochemistry test [FIT], guaiac-based fecal occult blood test [gFOBT], or FIT-DNA multitarget stool DNA testing [MT-sDNA]) is positive, a second stool test should not be done instead of a follow-up colonoscopy, because a subsequent negative stool test result does not mean that the first result was a false positive. Due to 2023 changes to CMS coverage, a follow-up colonoscopy after a positive noninvasive stool based test is now considered part of a continuum of complete CRC screening, and patient cost-sharing does not apply [59]. Additionally, if the patient has gastrointestinal symptoms or signs (eg, iron deficiency anemia), a diagnostic evaluation of the entire colon is indicated, even if a noninvasive test is negative. (See \"Evaluation of occult gastrointestinal bleeding\", section on 'Evaluation of a positive fecal occult blood test'.)\nPerforming the colonoscopy promptly and within three months is advised. Prompt follow-up colonoscopy minimizes the potential for progression of a preclinical lesion to a less curable stage due to a delay in follow-up testing [60,61]. In a retrospective cohort of >70,000 patients aged 50 to 70 who had a positive FIT between 2010 and 2014, rates of detection of any CRC or advanced CRC increased with increasing intervals between FIT and colonoscopy [62]. We therefore do not recommend screening patients if there is no access to colonoscopy if the test is positive.\nThe further evaluation and management of patients with colonoscopy-detected CRC and polyps are described separately. (See \"Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and staging of colorectal cancer\" and \"Overview of colon polyps\".)\nWhen a screening FIT, gFOBT, or MT-sDNA stool test is positive, and colonoscopy is both complete (to the cecum with adequate bowel preparation) and without abnormality, patients should return to the routine screening schedule.\nWhile some clinicians may be concerned that a positive MT-sDNA test in the setting of a normal colonoscopy may represent a true rather than a false positive, the available data suggest that such patients do not have a higher risk of cancer than the general population [63]. While this suggests that returning to the routine screening schedule is reasonable for patients with an apparent false-positive MT-sDNA test, larger studies with longer follow-up are needed to confirm these findings.\nSOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS\nLinks to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately. (See \"Society guideline links: Screening for colorectal cancer\".)\nINFORMATION FOR PATIENTS\nUpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, \"The Basics\" and \"Beyond the Basics.\" The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5th to 6th grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10th to 12th grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.\nHere are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on \"patient info\" and the keyword(s) of interest.)\n\u25cf\nBasics topics (see \"Patient education: Colon and rectal cancer screening (The Basics)\")\n\u25cf\nBeyond the Basics topics (see \"Patient education: Screening for colorectal cancer (Beyond the Basics)\" and \"Patient education: Colonoscopy (Beyond the Basics)\" and \"Patient education: Flexible sigmoidoscopy (Beyond the Basics)\")\nSUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n\u25cf\nScreening rationale \u2013 Screening for colorectal cancer (CRC) can identify premalignant lesions and detect asymptomatic early-stage malignancy that have greater chance of being cured. Screening has been shown to decrease mortality from CRC, and organized screening has been shown to reduce disparities; most of the risks of CRC screening are due to the risks of colonoscopy. (See 'Natural history of colorectal cancer and colon polyps' above and 'Benefits of screening' above and 'Harms associated with screening' above.)\n\u25cf\nAssessing risk \u2013 We do an initial risk assessment to determine if a patient is at increased risk for CRC at a first office visit and update the information at a minimum of every five years. Patients at sufficiently increased risk to change screening recommendations (eg, start screening at an earlier age and/or perform screening more frequently) include those with a personal or family history of CRC or advanced adenomatous polyp and other risk factors. (See 'Assessing risk for colorectal cancer' above.)\n\u25cf\nAge to initiate and discontinue screening \u2013 We recommend that average-risk patients age \u2265 45 years be screened for CRC (Grade 1A).\n\u2022\nWe initiate screening at age 45 years in most average-risk adults to balance the benefits of detection and prevention with the burden on the patient and the risk of harms from screening. (See 'Age to initiate screening' above.)\n\u2022\nWe continue to screen for CRC through age 75 years for average-risk patients, as long as their life expectancy is 10 years or greater. Screening at least until age 75 years for patients at average risk for CRC is recommended by most guidelines. Screening decisions should be individualized and based on shared decision-making for those aged 76 to 85 years. Screening until age 86 may be reasonable for patients who have never been screened, depending on their comorbidities. (See 'Discontinuing screening' above.)\n\u25cf\nDiscussing screening tests with patients \u2013 After determining that a patient is at average risk for CRC, we use a motivational interviewing and shared decision-making process to discuss specific CRC screening test protocols. Individual patient preferences, values, and risk, as well as test effectiveness, resource availability, test safety, convenience, comfort, and cost, are factors in determining which screening test among those recommended by guidelines groups is preferred by a specific patient. (See 'Advising patients about screening' above.)\n\u25cf\nOur approach \u2013 A variety of tests are endorsed for screening by major guidelines. The numbers of CRC deaths averted appear to be relatively similar across modalities that are recommended by guidelines, although the frequency of testing and the sensitivity and specificity for detection of polyps and of CRC vary, as shown in the figure (figure 1).\n\u2022\nWe advise colonoscopy every 10 years for most patients at average risk for CRC who are willing to undergo this procedure. We advise screening by FIT for occult blood annually on a single sample, by multitarget stool DNA (MT-sDNA) testing every one to three years, or by computed tomography colonography (CTC) every five years for patients unable or unwilling to have a colonoscopy as initial screening, or when access to colonoscopy is limited, with the understanding that if the other test result is positive, colonoscopy needs to be performed promptly. (See 'Preferred tests' above.)\n\u2022\nOther tests available for CRC screening include sigmoidoscopy with FIT or with gFOBT, sigmoidoscopy alone, gFOBT alone, and capsule colonoscopy. (See 'Other tests used' above.)\n\u2022\nColorectal cancer screening should not be based on an office-based gFOBT performed following a digital rectal examination (DRE). Barium enema tests are no longer recommended for screening because other tests are more effective. (See 'Tests that are less effective or lack sufficient evidence on effectiveness' above.)\n\u25cf\nFollow-up of abnormal results \u2013 Every positive CRC screening test other than colonoscopy should be followed expeditiously by a colonoscopy to visualize the entire colon, evaluate lesions, and remove polyps. (See 'Follow-up of abnormal results' above.)\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe UpToDate editorial staff acknowledges Robert H Fletcher, MD, MSc, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.\nThe author, Dr. Chyke Doubeni, was a member of the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF).

Bleeding is usually associated with polypectomy and rarely follows colonoscopy without intervention. Bleeding can occur immediately following polypectomy or can occur in a delayed manner several hours to weeks after the procedure. The severity of bleeding ranges from minor oozing to arterial bleeding, and in most patients, the bleeding can be controlled endoscopically.\nThis topic will review the management and prevention of bleeding after colonoscopy with polypectomy.\nThe etiology, clinical features and diagnosis of lower gastrointestinal bleeding are discussed separately. (See \"Etiology of lower gastrointestinal bleeding in adults\" and \"Approach to acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding in adults\".)\nOther complications related to colonoscopy, including the risk of perforation, are discussed separately. (See \"Overview of colonoscopy in adults\", section on 'Adverse events'.)\nThe clinical features, classification and management of colon polyps are discussed separately. (See \"Overview of colon polyps\", section on 'Endoscopic features and classification'.)\nTo continue reading this article, you must sign in with your personal, hospital, or group practice subscription.\nSubscribe\nSign in\nDisclaimer: This generalized information is a limited summary of diagnosis, treatment, and/or medication information.

This topic will review the evaluation of patients with BRBPR based on age and other risk factors for more serious etiologies of minimal BRBPR. The approach to patients who pass larger amounts of blood or blood intermixed with stool is discussed elsewhere. (See \"Approach to acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding in adults\".)\nDEFINITION\nRectal passage of minimal bright red blood most commonly occurs in a chronic intermittent pattern and has also been referred to as \"intermittent scant hematochezia\" [1]. The term minimal bright red blood per rectum (BRBPR) is used in this topic to indicate small amounts of red blood on toilet paper after wiping or a few drops of blood in the toilet bowl after defecation. Small amounts of blood on the surface of the stool is also considered minimal BRBPR, but red blood intermixed with stool is not.\nA history of minimal BRBPR suggests a lesion near the anal canal but must be differentiated from a history of melena (which implies upper gastrointestinal or slow proximal colonic bleeding) or maroon stool with intermixed bright red blood (which implies a proximal colonic or small intestinal source). However, patients' and clinicians' perceptions of stool color vary widely, even when assisted by a standardized color chart [2,3].\nBenign etiologies of BRBPR are common and appear to account for 90 percent or more of all episodes of minimal BRBPR. The true proportion of benign etiologies may be even higher, since many young people with minimal BRBPR never present for care. However, scant rectal bleeding is also a common presenting symptom of serious diagnoses, such as colorectal cancer [4-6].\nEPIDEMIOLOGY\nBy self-report, minimal bright red blood per rectum (BRBPR) occurs in approximately 15 percent of adults, and may be even more common in younger adults who may be less likely to seek medical consultation for this problem [7-9].\nTo continue reading this article, you must sign in with your personal, hospital, or group practice subscription.\nSubscribe\nSign in\nDisclaimer: This generalized information is a limited summary of diagnosis, treatment, and/or medication information.

The causes of acute lower GI bleeding may be grouped into several categories: anatomic (diverticulosis), vascular (angiodysplasia, ischemic, radiation-induced), inflammatory (infectious, inflammatory bowel disease), and neoplastic. In addition, acute lower GI bleeding can occur after therapeutic interventions such as polypectomy. (See \"Etiology of lower gastrointestinal bleeding in adults\" and \"Management and prevention of bleeding after colonoscopy with polypectomy\".)\nThis topic will review the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and initial management of acute GI bleeding thought to be coming from the colon. The etiology of lower GI bleeding and the treatment of specific causes of bleeding, as well as approaches to patients with upper GI bleeding, minimal rectal bleeding, suspected small bowel bleeding, and occult GI bleeding, are discussed separately. (See \"Etiology of lower gastrointestinal bleeding in adults\" and \"Colonic diverticular bleeding\" and \"Angiodysplasia of the gastrointestinal tract\" and \"Management and prevention of bleeding after colonoscopy with polypectomy\" and \"Approach to acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding in adults\" and \"Approach to minimal bright red blood per rectum in adults\" and \"Evaluation of suspected small bowel bleeding (formerly obscure gastrointestinal bleeding)\" and \"Evaluation of occult gastrointestinal bleeding\".)\nOVERVIEW\nPatients with acute lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding typically present with hematochezia, although hematochezia may also be seen in patients with massive upper GI or small bowel bleeding. Rarely, patients with right-sided colonic bleeding will present with melena. The bleeding will stop spontaneously in 80 to 85 percent of patients, and the mortality rate is 2 to 4 percent [1]. (See 'Clinical manifestations' below.)\nIn patients suspected of having acute lower GI bleeding, the approach to diagnosis and management includes (algorithm 1):\n\u25cf\nGeneral management, including obtaining adequate intravenous access, triaging the patient to the appropriate level of care, and providing supportive measures such as supplemental oxygen (see 'Initial evaluation and management' below)\nTo continue reading this article, you must sign in with your personal, hospital, or group practice subscription.\nSubscribe\nSign in\nDisclaimer: This generalized information is a limited summary of diagnosis, treatment, and/or medication information.

Colon polyps are usually asymptomatic but may ulcerate and bleed, cause tenesmus if in the rectum, and, when very large, produce intestinal obstruction. Colonic polyps may be neoplastic (eg, adenomas) or non-neoplastic (eg, inflammatory polyps).\nThis topic will review the clinical features and management of colonic polyps and polypoid lesions of the colon.

Inflammatory polyps include inflammatory pseudopolyps and prolapse type inflammatory polyps.\nInflammatory pseudopolyps \u2014 Inflammatory pseudopolyps are irregularly shaped islands of residual intact colonic mucosa that are the result of the mucosal ulceration and regeneration that occurs in response to localized or diffuse inflammation (eg, ulcerative colitis or Crohn disease).\n\u25cf\nEndoscopic features and histology \u2013 Inflammatory polyps may be pedunculated or sessile and are usually smaller than 2 cm. Inflammatory pseudopolyps in patients with inflammatory bowel disease are typically multiple, often filiform, and scattered throughout the involved areas of the colon. They may also be more isolated and semipedunculated in areas of recent inflammation, and have mucus adherent to their apices (picture 1). Inflammatory pseudopolyps are composed of a mixture of inflamed lamina propria and distorted colonic epithelium; surface erosions may or may not be present.\nTo continue reading this article, you must sign in with your personal, hospital, or group practice subscription.\nSubscribe\nSign in\nDisclaimer: This generalized information is a limited summary of diagnosis, treatment, and/or medication information.

Over 50 million GI endoscopic procedures were performed in the United States alone in 2017, including approximately 19 million colonoscopies [3].\nThis topic will discuss anesthetic management for both routine and advanced GI endoscopy. Management of monitored anesthesia care (MAC), office-based anesthesia, and procedural sedation and alternatives to sedation administered by non-anesthesia clinicians are discussed separately. (See \"Monitored anesthesia care in adults\" and \"Gastrointestinal endoscopy in adults: Procedural sedation administered by endoscopists\" and \"Sedation-free gastrointestinal endoscopy\" and \"Office-based anesthesia\".)\nPREPROCEDURE EVALUATION\nA medical history and anesthesia-directed physical examination should be performed in all patients who undergo any type of anesthesia, including sedation for endoscopy. The goals of preanesthesia evaluation are to identify underlying medical and physical conditions that may increase risks and to formulate an anesthetic plan that minimizes these risks. Hypoxemia and aspiration are the most frequent complications among patients undergoing GI endoscopic procedures. (See 'Complications' below.)\nIn anticipation of GI endoscopy, the patient should be evaluated for conditions that increase sensitivity to sedative and analgesic medications (eg, older age; obstructive sleep apnea; advanced chronic lung disease; pulmonary hypertension; coronary artery, liver, or severe kidney disease). Patients should also be evaluated for conditions that may require increased doses of sedatives and analgesics (eg, anxiety disorders; chronic pain; use of opioids, sedatives, or recreational drugs such as marijuana) to allow appropriate drug dosing and administration.

Despite receiving potentially curative primary therapy, more than 40 percent of patients who present with stage II or III disease (table 1) will experience disease recurrence. (See \"Adjuvant therapy for resected stage III (node-positive) colon cancer\" and \"Adjuvant therapy for resected rectal adenocarcinoma in patients not receiving neoadjuvant therapy\" and \"Neoadjuvant therapy for rectal adenocarcinoma\".)\nThere has been and continues to be considerable variability among physicians in the use of follow-up studies after potentially curative resection of CRC and in the guidelines from major societies and expert groups. Multiple surveillance strategies have been published at costs ranging from a few hundred to several thousand dollars per patient.\nIntensive postoperative surveillance programs have been justified in the hope that early detection of asymptomatic recurrences will increase the proportion of patients who are potentially eligible for curative therapy. A survival benefit from such an approach has in fact been shown in several meta-analyses. Furthermore, periodic imaging can detect early, potentially resectable recurrences.\nThis topic review will cover the rationale for intensive post-treatment surveillance in the first five years after treatment, data on the effectiveness of various surveillance strategies, and recommendations for post-treatment surveillance in patients with resected CRC, including recommendations from expert groups. Recommendations for secondary prevention (dietary modification, exercise, use of aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) and management of long-term CRC survivors are discussed separately. (See \"The roles of diet, physical activity, and body weight in cancer survivors\" and \"Adjunctive therapy for patients with resected early stage colorectal cancer: Diet, exercise, NSAIDs, and vitamin D\", section on 'Aspirin and other NSAIDs' and \"Approach to the care of colorectal cancer survivors\" and \"Adjuvant therapy for resected stage III (node-positive) colon cancer\", section on 'Adjunctive therapy' and \"Adjunctive therapy for patients with resected early stage colorectal cancer: Diet, exercise, NSAIDs, and vitamin D\".)\nSTAGE I DISEASE\nThere are no data available to guide post-treatment surveillance in patients with resected stage I colon or rectal cancer (table 1), and the recommendations of expert groups are variable. Consistent with updated American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines [1], we do not pursue any post-treatment surveillance strategy for most asymptomatic patients with resected stage I colorectal cancer (CRC), with the exception of interval colonoscopy. However, some of these patients have higher-risk disease (eg, rectal cancer treated with endoscopic or transanal excision, colon cancers treated with endoscopic resection alone, and patients who did not undergo guideline-based treatment) for whom surveillance-based detection as is used for higher-stage disease might reveal a potentially salvageable recurrence.\nTo continue reading this article, you must sign in with your personal, hospital, or group practice subscription.\nSubscribe\nSign in\nDisclaimer: This generalized information is a limited summary of diagnosis, treatment, and/or medication information.

Endoscopic tattooing is the most common method for marking a gastrointestinal lesion or site, although other methods (eg, endoscopic clip placement combined with imaging) are also available. Tattoos are most often placed in the colon, although any area of the luminal gastrointestinal tract can be marked for future reference (eg, small bowel).\nThis topic will discuss methods to localize gastrointestinal lesions or specific sites, with a focus on the application of endoscopic techniques for tattooing. Other issues related to colonoscopy including indications, patient preparation, technical aspects, and adverse events are discussed separately. (See \"Overview of colonoscopy in adults\" and \"Bowel preparation before colonoscopy in adults\".)\nTATTOOING\nGeneral principles\nGoal \u2014 The goal of tattooing is to facilitate accurate localization of a gastrointestinal mucosal lesion, a specific location in the luminal gastrointestinal tract, or the site of a prior endoscopic resection during a follow-up surgical or endoscopic procedure. Anatomic descriptions (eg, transverse colon) refer to a general location but are often imprecise for identifying specific areas in the small or large bowel. (See 'Other methods for localization' below.)\nDeciding to tattoo based on lesion's location \u2014 Tattoos can be applied to any portion of the gastrointestinal mucosa and are most frequently used in the colon; however, colonic lesions located in the cecum or rectum generally do not require tattooing prior to resection if they are readily visible because of the ease of identifying these locations endoscopically. For example, a large polyp (\u22652 cm) in the cecum or the proximal ascending colon that will be referred to an advanced endoscopist for resection can be photographed rather than placing a tattoo, provided that the appendiceal orifice and/or ileocecal valve is in view or is in close proximity [1]. Alternatively, the resection site of a small rectal neuroendocrine (carcinoid) tumor (<1 cm) may be marked by the advanced endoscopist so that the site can be more easily identified during a follow-up surveillance procedure. (See 'Surveillance examination' below and \"Staging, treatment, and surveillance of localized well-differentiated gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumors\", section on 'Rectum'.)\nClinical applications\nSurgical or endoscopic localization \u2014 Tattooing is used primarily in the colon for patients who have a lesion suspicious for cancer (eg, exophytic mass) or a large polyp (\u22652 cm) that is detected during colonoscopy and requires subsequent surgical or endoscopic resection [2-4].

By contrast, the term overt is used to describe blood loss that is visible to the patient or clinician. Overt bleeding may manifest as hematemesis, melena, or hematochezia.\nThe major cause of iron deficiency in developed countries is blood loss [2]. In male patients, the blood loss is most commonly from the GI tract; in premenopausal female patients, menstrual blood loss must also be considered [3]. (See \"Causes and diagnosis of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia in adults\".)\nThe initial evaluation of patients with occult GI bleeding will be reviewed here. The evaluation of patients with overt GI bleeding, the evaluation for occult GI blood loss as it relates to screening for colorectal cancer, and the evaluation of patients with suspected small bowel bleeding (previously referred to as obscure GI bleeding) are discussed separately. (See \"Evaluation of suspected small bowel bleeding (formerly obscure gastrointestinal bleeding)\" and \"Approach to acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding in adults\" and \"Approach to acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding in adults\" and \"Tests for screening for colorectal cancer\".)\nCAUSES OF OCCULT GI BLEEDING\nThe differential diagnosis for occult GI bleeding is broad (table 1 and table 2). Some of the more common causes include colon cancer, esophagitis, peptic ulcers, gastritis, inflammatory bowel disease, vascular ectasias, portal hypertensive gastropathy, gastric antral vascular ectasias, and small bowel tumors (eg, GI stromal cell tumor, lymphoma, carcinoid, adenocarcinoma, or polyp). However, less common causes, such as gastroesophageal cancers, hemosuccus pancreaticus, hemobilia, endometriosis, and infections also need to be considered. In addition, hemorrhoids can rarely lead to a positive fecal occult blood test [4]. While overt bleeding from hemorrhoids can result in anemia, anemia in the setting of occult GI bleeding should not be attributed to hemorrhoids. Non-GI sources of blood loss, such as hemoptysis and epistaxis, can also cause a positive fecal occult blood test.\nThe medical history and physical examination can help focus the differential diagnosis. As examples, colon cancer is a likely cause in patients older than 50 years, small bowel tumors are often seen in patients under the age of 40 years, and angiodysplasias are seen in association with several conditions, including aortic stenosis, renal disease, and presence of a left ventricular assist device. The presence of oral telangiectasias may signal the presence of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome), and mucocutaneous pigmentation may be due to Peutz-Jeghers syndrome in which hamartomatous polyps may ulcerate and cause occult GI bleeding.

Adequate patient tolerance is essential for successful completion of a safe examination and compliance with subsequent follow-up. As a result, endoscopists have developed skills in administering a variety of sedative and analgesic agents to facilitate procedures and enhance patient comfort.\nMost of the attention has been placed on selecting the optimal regimen for producing procedural sedation and monitoring patients adequately during the procedures. There has been some attempt to determine which patients and which procedures require deeper sedation to achieve optimal conditions. Finally, there has been an effort to make some of the diagnostic procedures more tolerable to avoid the cost and risk of procedural sedation altogether.\nThis topic review will focus on sedation-free endoscopy. Standard methods of procedural sedation and their complications, recommendations for procedural sedation, and the management of patients who are difficult to sedate are discussed separately. (See \"Gastrointestinal endoscopy in adults: Procedural sedation administered by endoscopists\" and \"Adverse events related to procedural sedation for gastrointestinal endoscopy in adults\" and \"Anesthesia for gastrointestinal endoscopy in adults\".)\nRATIONALE\nUnsedated endoscopy may be advantageous for several reasons. First, it significantly decreases the risk of hypoxemia and respiratory depression. Second, it reduces the procedure and recovery room time, and the associated costs. Third, it allows patients to leave the endoscopy unit after the procedure without delay and return to work if they so choose, which may produce economic benefit by reducing the indirect costs of endoscopy. Furthermore, a number of studies have demonstrated satisfactory outcomes when focusing on parameters such as successful completion of examinations, patient satisfaction with their comfort level, and their willingness to undergo future examinations without sedation (see below). As a result, in many countries, upper endoscopy, and to a lesser extent, colonoscopy, are commonly performed without routine procedural sedation [1-3]. By contrast, sedation-free endoscopy is not widely accepted in the United States [4].\nThe use of procedural sedation varies considerably among different countries, reflecting different practice standards and social customs. As an example, in a survey of International Editors for the journal Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, sedation was always or usually administered in 44 percent of procedures in Asia, 56 percent in Europe, and 72 percent in the Americas (Canada, Central and South America) [5]. In the United States, only flexible sigmoidoscopy is typically performed without sedation.\nTo continue reading this article, you must sign in with your personal, hospital, or group practice subscription.\nSubscribe\nSign in\nDisclaimer: This generalized information is a limited summary of diagnosis, treatment, and/or medication information.

Although often diagnosed in the emergency department, patients with uncomplicated disease who are otherwise well are often treated as outpatients. Additionally, all patients will require outpatient follow-up after resolution of their acute symptoms.\nThe outpatient management and follow-up of acute colonic diverticulitis is the focus of this topic. Initial triage and inpatient management are discussed in another topic. (See \"Acute colonic diverticulitis: Triage and inpatient management\".)\nThe epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, complications, and surgical treatment of diverticulitis are discussed elsewhere:\n\u25cf\n(See \"Colonic diverticulosis and diverticular disease: Epidemiology, risk factors, and pathogenesis\".)\n\u25cf\n(See \"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of acute colonic diverticulitis in adults\".)\n\u25cf\n(See \"Diverticular fistulas\".)\n\u25cf\n(See \"Colonic diverticular bleeding\".)\n\u25cf\n(See \"Acute colonic diverticulitis: Surgical management\".)\nINITIAL OUTPATIENT CARE\nUncomplicated diverticulitis in patients who meet certain criteria can be managed entirely as outpatients. These criteria are outlined in this table (table 1) and discussed in detail elsewhere. (See \"Acute colonic diverticulitis: Triage and inpatient management\", section on 'Triage'.)\nThe initial care typically consists of pain control with oral analgesics (eg, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, oxycodone) and a liquid diet. Antibiotics are usually not required. Ibuprofen or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should be stopped as soon as the acute episode has resolved, as chronic use has been associated with diverticular complications. (See 'Dietary modification and supplements' below.)\nNo oral antibiotics \u2014 Antibiotics used to be the cornerstone of diverticulitis treatment. However, such practice was largely based upon retrospective studies and clinical experience rather than high-quality evidence [1,2]. In an open-label randomized trial (DINAMO) of 480 patients with imaging-confirmed uncomplicated diverticulitis whose symptoms were adequately controlled in the emergency department, outpatient treatment with or without amoxicillin-clavulanic acid resulted in similarly low rates of unscheduled return visits (6.7 versus 7 percent) or hospitalization (6 versus 3 percent) [3]. Additional trials, mostly from Europe, also showed that antibiotics may not be necessary for selected patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis who are treated in the hospital. Inpatient treatment of diverticulitis is discussed elsewhere. (See \"Acute colonic diverticulitis: Triage and inpatient management\", section on 'Intravenous antibiotics'.)\nThe exclusion criteria used in the DINAMO trial were almost identical to the criteria used to determine need for inpatient treatment (table 1). Thus, we suggest that patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis without the characteristics suggestive of either severe disease or serious comorbidities be managed initially with pain control and a liquid diet but without antibiotics [3].\nOur suggestion for the selective use of antibiotics to treat uncomplicated diverticulitis is consistent with recommendations from the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) [4,5], American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons (ASCRS) [6], European Association of Endoscopic Surgery (EAES)/Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES) [7], and American College of Physicians (ACP) [8].\nOral antibiotics for acute colonic diverticulitis in adults\nTable 2\nHowever, clinicians may reasonably choose to use antibiotics for individual patients who have major medical comorbidities, have immunocompromising conditions, use medications causing immunomodulation, or show signs of systemic disturbance. Oral antibiotics appropriate for diverticulitis are listed in this table (table 2).\nOutpatient diet \u2014 There is no evidence for dietary restrictions in acute uncomplicated diverticulitis. Some guidelines allow regular diet in patients who can tolerate it, while others endorse a \"modified\" diet [9]. One approach is to limit patients to a liquid diet until they can be reassessed within a week, after which their diet can be liberalized to soft or regular if they demonstrate clinical improvement.\nSUBSEQUENT OUTPATIENT CARE\nPatients should be reassessed in the clinic within one week of their initial presentation to the emergency room or discharge from the hospital. Thereafter, all patients should be reassessed weekly until all symptoms resolve.\nPatients who improve \u2014 Repeat imaging studies are not necessary in patients who continue to demonstrate clinical improvement. Upon resolution of all symptoms, patients should be monitored for any recurrence of symptoms and undergo colonoscopy in six to eight weeks if they have not done so within the previous year. (See 'Colonoscopy for all patients following diverticulitis' below.)\nManagement of acute colonic diverticulitis\nAlgorithm 1\nPatients who do not improve \u2014 Patients with worsening pain, new onset fever, or the inability to tolerate oral fluids should be admitted for inpatient treatment (algorithm 1). Abdominopelvic computed tomography (CT) imaging may be repeated to rule out a new complication. (See \"Acute colonic diverticulitis: Triage and inpatient management\", section on 'Inpatient treatment'.)\nIn a 2019 meta-analysis of 19 retrospective studies, the readmission rate for outpatient treatment of diverticulitis is low (7 percent, 95% CI 6-9) and comparable to that of inpatient controls [10].\nPERSISTENT OR RECURRENT SYMPTOMS\nA small proportion of patients who develop acute diverticulitis do not follow the classic pattern of disease progression. Such patients have been described as having \"smoldering\" diverticulitis [11,12]. Patients who have chronic smoldering diverticulitis typically have subacute but protracted symptoms of left lower quadrant abdominal pain, alteration in bowel habits, and/or rectal bleeding, often after cessation of antibiotics. These symptoms are chronic and may last for longer than six months.\nIn a two-year longitudinal study of patients participating in the DIABOLO (DIverticulitis: AntiBiotics Or cLose Observation?) trial [13], over one-third reported persistent symptoms such as flatulence (39 percent), rumblings (31 percent), many stools (30 percent), bloating (28 percent), fullness (28 percent), and severe urgency for defecation (27 percent) [14]. However, the absolute quality-of-life scores for several of such symptoms were actually comparable to those for healthy individuals in other studies, and only 22 percent of patients with ongoing abdominal complaints experienced a recurrent episode of diverticulitis within 24 months. Thus, for patients with persistent complaints after acute diverticulitis, it is important to distinguish between true smoldering or recurrent diverticulitis and other disease entities such as irritable bowel syndrome. (See \"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome in adults\" and \"Acute colonic diverticulitis: Surgical management\", section on 'Persistent symptoms'.)\nSmoldering diverticulitis is characterized by the key feature of colonic inflammation, which can be demonstrated by repeat CT scan, lower endoscopy, or laboratory test (eg, fecal calprotectin) [15]. A lack of colonic inflammation suggests that the symptoms may be due to function disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome, which do not require a surgical intervention.\nPatients with chronic smoldering diverticulitis should be referred for surgical evaluation [16]. Patients should be presented with the risks and benefits of colon resection so they can engage in shared decision making with the surgeon [15].\n\u25cf\nIn a randomized trial of patients with either smoldering or multirecurrent diverticulitis, elective colon resection resulted in better quality-of-life scores than conservative management at one and five years [17-19]. However, surgical complications included anastomotic leak (11 percent), reoperation (15 percent), and protective stomas (19 percent).\n\u25cf\nIn a systematic review, elective surgery reduced recurrence in patients with prior complicated, smoldering, or frequently recurrent diverticulitis [20].\nELECTIVE SURGERY FOR HIGH-RISK PATIENTS\nAfter successful nonoperative management of acute diverticulitis, elective surgery should be offered to patients who are at high risk of developing serious complications or dying from recurrent diverticulitis, including those with complicated diverticulitis and those who are immunosuppressed.\nElective colon resection is generally not offered to immunocompetent patients with a history of uncomplicated diverticulitis, regardless of the number of past episodes [4,6]. However, surgery may be offered to those patients who travel extensively, and patients who live in remote areas of the country without ready access to medical care.\nComplicated first episode \u2014 The 2020 American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons (ASCRS) guidelines recommended elective colon resection after successful nonoperative management of acute complicated diverticulitis [6]. There is evidence that patients with complicated diverticulitis are at higher risk of developing serious complications or dying from recurrent diverticulitis [21,22].\nPatients with fistulae, obstruction, and stricture obviously require definitive surgical intervention. However, the optimal management of a healed diverticular abscess is less certain [23], as some evidence suggests that it is not as significant a risk factor for future complicated recurrence [24]. Thus, for patients with a healed diverticular abscess, we suggest basing the decision to operate on the persistence of symptoms and effect on quality of life, rather than mandating surgery solely to avoid recurrent episodes. This is especially true if the patient is medically complicated. This area, however, is controversial and continues to evolve [25]. (See \"Acute colonic diverticulitis: Surgical management\", section on 'Patients with prior complicated attack'.)\nImmunosuppression \u2014 Patients who are immunosuppressed should also be considered for elective surgical resection. Compared with the general population, patients who are immunosuppressed are more likely to develop acute diverticulitis (0.02 versus 1 percent), more likely to require emergency surgery if they developed diverticulitis (10 to 25 versus 40 percent), and more likely to die if they underwent emergency surgery for diverticulitis (<5 versus 30 percent) [26-29].\nIn a retrospective study of 1332 immunosuppressed and 25,655 immunocompetent patients undergoing surgery for acute diverticulitis, immunosuppression was associated with a higher mortality rate after emergency surgery (odds ratio [OR] 1.79, 95% CI 1.17-2.75) but not elective surgery. After elective surgery, immunosuppressed patients were more likely to develop major complications (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.17-1.83) or wound dehiscence (OR 2.69, 95% CI 1.63-4.42) compared with immunocompetent patients [30].\nAcute diverticulitis is more severe in immunocompromised patients because their presentation is atypical and often delayed. Thus, most surgeons would offer elective surgery to immunocompromised patients who are medically fit after a single episode of diverticulitis because elective surgery carries much lower morbidity and mortality rates compared with emergency surgery [31]. The decision to pursue elective surgery, however, needs to be individualized, as some immunosuppressed patients may be poor surgical candidates due to comorbid conditions [6]. (See \"Acute colonic diverticulitis: Surgical management\", section on 'Patients who are immunocompromised'.)\nPatients can become immunocompromised from chemotherapy; immunosuppression for organ transplant; long-term glucocorticoid therapy; or chronic medical conditions such as diabetes, renal failure, or collagen-vascular disorders such as lupus [32,33].\nPatients with diabetes who present with acute diverticulitis have a higher incidence of complicated episodes but similar success with nonoperative management compared with patients without diabetes [7]. Patients with human immunodeficiency virus that is well controlled have similar postoperative complications to those of the general population; those with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome have higher morbidities and mortality [34]. Patients who are planning to undergo a limited course of chemotherapy should have their elective surgery delayed until after its completion.\nCOLONOSCOPY FOR ALL PATIENTS FOLLOWING DIVERTICULITIS\nAfter the complete resolution of symptoms associated with acute diverticulitis (typically in six to eight weeks), we suggest that a colonoscopy be performed to assess the extent of a patient's diverticular disease and exclude a concomitant colonic cancer, unless one has been performed within the previous year.\nThe cancer detection rate by colonoscopy is consistently much higher after complicated diverticulitis than after uncomplicated diverticulitis [20]. In two meta-analyses, colorectal cancer was detected by colonoscopy in 8.3 to 10.8 percent of patients with complicated diverticulitis but only in 0.5 to 0.7 percent of those with uncomplicated diverticulitis [35,36]. Thus, there is no controversy that colonoscopy should be performed after any episode of complicated diverticulitis.\nIt is controversial, however, whether colonoscopy is necessary after an episode of uncomplicated diverticulitis. In this cohort of patients, the detection rate of colorectal cancer varies by study. In a single-center retrospective study of 978 patients who underwent colonoscopy or gastrointestinal surgery after CT diagnosis of diverticulitis, 2.7 percent were found to have colorectal cancer and 5 percent to have advanced adenoma [37]. In two retrospective studies of 545 and 185 patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis, however, routine colonoscopy did not detect any colorectal cancer [38,39].\nThe 2018 European Association for Endoscopic Surgery (EAES)/Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES) guidelines failed to reach a consensus, with American experts in favor of routine colonoscopy but European experts against colonoscopy for patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis [7]. The 2020 American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons (ASCRS) guidelines recommended colonoscopy after all complicated diverticulitis and after uncomplicated diverticulitis with imaging abnormalities or atypical courses [6]. The 2022 American College of Physicians (ACP) guidelines recommended colonoscopy after complicated diverticulitis [16].\nGiven the low risk of colonoscopy, we, along with other major societies [4], recommend colonoscopy for all patients after an episode of uncomplicated diverticulitis, unless they have had one in the previous year. (See \"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of acute colonic diverticulitis in adults\", section on 'Exclusion of an underlying malignancy'.)\nDIETARY MODIFICATION AND SUPPLEMENTS\nIn order to prevent recurrence, patients with a history of colonic diverticulitis should consume a high-fiber diet; however, they do not need to avoid seeds, corn, and nuts [4]. Patients should also refrain from chronic or excessive use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or aspirin unless prescribed for cardiovascular purposes. Further studies are required before mesalamine or other agents (eg, rifaximin, probiotics) can be recommended for prevention of recurrent diverticulitis [4].\n\u25cf\nHealthy lifestyle \u2013 Patients should be advised to lead a healthy lifestyle, which entails tobacco cessation, physical activities and weight loss, and reduced meat intake [40,41]. A high-fiber diet is also recommended once the acute phase of diverticulitis has resolved [42]. This recommendation is based upon observational studies that suggested long-term fiber supplementation may reduce the incidence of recurrent diverticulitis [43,44]. Indirect support for fiber supplementation also comes from studies that demonstrated the protective effect of a high-fiber diet on the development of diverticular disease [45]. However, although a healthy lifestyle has been shown to prevent the first episode of diverticulitis, its role in secondary prevention in patients who already had diverticulitis is uncertain [46,47].\n\u25cf\nSeeds, corn, and nuts \u2013 Patients with diverticular disease have historically been advised to avoid consuming seeds, corn, and nuts out of concern that undigested fragments of such food items could become lodged within the diverticulum and incite diverticulitis. However, this theory is completely unproven. In a large prospective study of 47,228 patients, nut, corn, and popcorn consumption did not increase the risk of developing diverticulitis or its associated complications (eg, bleeding) [48]. Thus, we do not counsel patients with a history of diverticulitis against consuming seeds, corn, and nuts.\n\u25cf\nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and aspirin \u2013 There is observational evidence that associated both NSAIDs and aspirin with diverticular bleed and complicated diverticulitis [49-51]. Although the association does not prove causation, it is generally advised for patients with a history of diverticulitis to avoid chronic or excessive use of NSAIDs or aspirin, with the exception of those who take aspirin for cardiovascular purposes [52].\n\u25cf\nMesalamine \u2013 Based upon the theory that chronic inflammation plays a role in diverticulitis, anti-inflammatory agents, such as mesalamine, have been used to treat diverticulitis [53-57]. A 2017 Cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis of seven randomized trials, however, found no evidence of an effect when comparing mesalamine with control for prevention of recurrent diverticulitis (31.3 versus 29.8 percent; relative risk 0.69, 95% CI 0.43-1.09; very low quality of evidence) [58]. Therefore, we do not suggest mesalamine to prevent recurrent diverticulitis [7,16,20]. There is even less evidence to support the use of other agents such as rifaximin [59] and probiotics [60].\nRECURRENT DIVERTICULITIS\nOverall, between 16 and 42 percent of patients have one or more recurrent episode(s) after nonoperative management of acute diverticulitis [21,61-63]. Thus, most patients (58 to 84 percent) do not develop recurrent diverticulitis. Two large cohort studies followed tens of thousands of patients for four years after their first episode of acute diverticulitis and documented low rates of both hospital readmission and surgery:\n\u25cf\nIn an English study of over 65,000 patients managed nonoperatively for their first episode of diverticulitis, the readmission rate for recurrent diverticulitis after a minimum follow-up of four years was 11.2 percent; 0.9 and 0.75 percent required emergency and elective colectomy, respectively. Female sex, young age, smoking, obesity, and complicated initial disease were risk factors for readmission and emergency surgery by regression analyses [64].\n\u25cf\nIn a Canadian study of over 14,000 patients followed for a median of almost four years, the readmission rate was 9 percent, and 1.9 and 1.7 percent required emergency and elective colectomy, respectively. In regression analyses, complicated initial disease was a risk factor for both readmission and emergency surgery, while age <50 was a risk factor for readmission but not emergency surgery [65].\nStudies show that recurrent diverticulitis is usually not more severe, or \"virulent,\" than the initial episode:\n\u25cf\nIn 672 patients who were followed for five years after nonoperative management of diverticulitis, 36 percent had a recurrence at five years, but only 4 percent had a complicated recurrence (eg, abscess, perforation, or fistula) [61].\n\u25cf\nIn a retrospective study of 1300 patients with acute diverticulitis, frank perforation occurred in 25 percent of patients with their first episode, 12 percent with their second episode, 6 percent with their third episode, and only 1 percent thereafter [66].\nAlthough surgery was once advised for patients who have had two or more uncomplicated episodes of diverticulitis, there is increasing evidence that such arbitrary guidelines should be abandoned [67-69]. The guidelines from the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons (ASCRS) called for an individualized approach to recommending elective sigmoid colectomy after recovery from uncomplicated diverticulitis [6]. Considering the risk of colostomies associated with elective resection, the risk of ostomy is not lower after surgery than without surgery (4 versus 1.6 percent) [70]. The complication and colostomy rates associated with surgery after four episodes were no higher than after one episode [6]. Furthermore, more episodes of diverticulitis were not associated with a higher rate of conversion from laparoscopic to open surgery [71].\nSurgery, however, may be indicated in patients with recurrent diverticulitis who develop symptoms. In a systematic review of 80 studies, 20 to 35 percent of patients managed nonoperatively developed chronic abdominal pain, compared with 5 to 25 percent of patients treated surgically [72]. Overall, approximately 15 percent of patients with acute diverticulitis will require surgical intervention at some time during the course of their disease [72], nearly all of whom have had either a complicated episode or several uncomplicated episodes of diverticulitis [6].\nRecurrence after surgery for uncomplicated diverticulitis occurs in 6 percent of patients at one year and 16 percent at five years [70]; patients with a colosigmoid anastomosis where the distal resection did not extend to the rectum had four times as many recurrences as those with a colorectal anastomosis [73,74]. It is therefore extremely important that the distal level of resection extend up to the rectum.

(See \"Society guideline links: Colonic diverticular disease\" and \"Society guideline links: Intra-abdominal infections in adults\".)\nINFORMATION FOR PATIENTS\nUpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, \"The Basics\" and \"Beyond the Basics.\" The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5th to 6th grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10th to 12th grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.\nHere are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on \"patient info\" and the keyword(s) of interest.)\n\u25cf\nBasics topics (see \"Patient education: Diverticulitis (The Basics)\")\n\u25cf\nBeyond the Basics topics (see \"Patient education: Diverticular disease (Beyond the Basics)\")\nSUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n\u25cf\nInitial outpatient care \u2013 Patients are initially managed with pain control with oral analgesics (eg, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or oxycodone) and a liquid diet. For most patients who are appropriate candidates for outpatient management of acute uncomplicated colonic diverticulitis, we suggest against antibiotic treatment (Grade 2B). There appear to be similar outcomes regardless of antibiotic use. However, clinicians may choose to use antibiotics in patients who have major medical comorbidities, have immunocompromising conditions, or show signs of systemic disturbance. When indicated, appropriate oral antibiotics are listed in this table (table 2). (See 'Initial outpatient care' above.)\n\u25cf\nSubsequent outpatient care \u2013 Patients should be reassessed clinically within a week of their initial presentation or discharge from the hospital, and weekly thereafter until the complete resolution of all symptoms. Repeat imaging studies are usually not necessary unless the patient fails to progress clinically. Patients who deteriorate or do not improve with outpatient therapy are (re)admitted for inpatient treatment (algorithm 1). (See 'Initial outpatient care' above.)\n\u25cf\nPersistent or recurrent symptoms \u2013 After out- or inpatient treatment of acute diverticulitis, those who have persistent or recurrent symptoms may have chronic smoldering diverticulitis, which is distinguished from other common gastrointestinal disorders (eg, irritable bowel syndrome) by the presence of colonic inflammation. Patients with chronic smoldering diverticulitis may benefit from surgical consultation for possible elective colon resection. (See 'Persistent or recurrent symptoms' above.)\n\u25cf\nCandidates for elective surgery \u2013 For patients who have had complicated diverticulitis (with the exception of some patients with a healed diverticular abscess and no symptoms) or who are immunosuppressed, we suggest elective colon resection (Grade 2C). Such patients are at high risk of developing serious complications or dying from recurrent diverticulitis and emergency surgery. (See 'Elective surgery for high-risk patients' above.)\nElective colon resection is generally not offered to asymptomatic, immunocompetent patients with a history of uncomplicated diverticulitis, regardless of the number of past episodes. However, surgery may be offered to patients who travel extensively, as well as patients who live in remote areas without ready access to medical care.\n\u25cf\nColonoscopy and dietary modification \u2013 All patient who are symptom free should undergo colonoscopy after six to eight weeks to rule out colon cancer unless one has been performed in the previous year. A high-fiber diet and a healthy lifestyle are also recommended to reduce the risk of recurrence, but not avoidance of nuts, corn, and seeds. Patients should also refrain from chronic or excessive use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or aspirin unless prescribed for cardiovascular purposes. (See 'Colonoscopy for all patients following diverticulitis' above and 'Dietary modification and supplements' above.)\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe editorial staff at UpToDate acknowledge Tonia Young-Fadok, MD, and John H Pemberton, MD, who contributed to earlier versions of this topic review.\nREFERENCES\nSchechter S, Mulvey J, Eisenstat TE.

Patients with diverticular bleeding usually experience large volume hematochezia and require hospitalization for management. Colonoscopy is the test of choice for most patients, although patients with massive bleeding may require computed tomography (CT) angiography followed by angiography [1]. Surgical intervention for diverticular bleeding is reserved for patients who have failed all other modalities.\nThis topic will review colonic diverticular bleeding. The general approach to lower gastrointestinal bleeding, the causes of lower gastrointestinal bleeding, and the evaluation of suspected small bowel bleeding are discussed elsewhere. (See \"Approach to acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding in adults\" and \"Etiology of lower gastrointestinal bleeding in adults\" and \"Evaluation of suspected small bowel bleeding (formerly obscure gastrointestinal bleeding)\".)\nEPIDEMIOLOGY\nColonic diverticular bleeding is the most common cause of hematochezia (maroon or bright red blood) in hospitalized patients, although the proportion of cases attributed to diverticular bleeding varies across series. For example, 13 percent of cases were attributed to diverticular bleeding in a multicenter study in the United Kingdom versus 63 percent in a multicenter study in Japan. These differences may reflect differences in biology (right-sided diverticulosis, which is more likely to bleed, is more common in Japan) or approach (26 percent underwent endoscopy in the United Kingdom study, mostly flexible sigmoidoscopy, versus 88 percent in the Japanese study) [2,3].  \nAmong patients with asymptomatic diverticulosis, the risk of bleeding is approximately 0.5 per 1000 person-years [4]. In a study of 1514 asymptomatic patients with diverticulosis, the cumulative incidence of bleeding was 0.2 percent at 12 months, 2.2 percent at 60 months, and 9.5 percent at 120 months [4]. Risk factors for bleeding included age \u226570 years (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 3.7) and bilateral diverticulosis (aHR 2.4). Obesity, aspirin, and non-aspirin nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs increase the risk of incident diverticular bleeding [5,6].\nUnlike diverticulitis, which occurs primarily in the left colon, the right colon is the source of colonic diverticular bleeding in 50 to 90 percent of patients [7-10]. This reflects a marked increase in propensity for right-sided diverticula to bleed since in Western countries only 25 percent of diverticula are right-sided [11].\nTo continue reading this article, you must sign in with your personal, hospital, or group practice subscription.\nSubscribe\nSign in\nDisclaimer: This generalized information is a limited summary of diagnosis, treatment, and/or medication information.

Previously, antibiotic prophylaxis was recommended for many GI procedures in patients with high-risk cardiac conditions to protect against infective endocarditis. However, practices have substantially changed, in part due to the low incidence of infective endocarditis following GI procedures and the lack of randomized trials supporting the benefit of antibiotic prophylaxis. Furthermore, the indiscriminate use of antibiotics can be associated with the development of resistant organisms, Clostridioides difficile colitis, unnecessary expense, and drug toxicity. (See \"Clostridioides difficile infection in adults: Epidemiology, microbiology, and pathophysiology\", section on 'Antibiotic use'.)\nRecommendations for antibiotic prophylaxis prior to GI procedures will be reviewed here. General issues related to prophylaxis for bacterial endocarditis are discussed separately. (See \"Prevention of endocarditis: Antibiotic prophylaxis and other measures\".)\nSeveral professional societies have published guidelines on antibiotic prophylaxis for GI procedures, and our approach is generally consistent with these guidelines [1-3].\nPATHOGENESIS\nInfections following endoscopic procedures are rare and are presumably the result of bacteremia induced during the procedure or, in the case of procedures such as pancreatic cyst aspiration, the result of inoculation with bacteria during the procedure.\nBacteremia results from translocation of endogenous bacteria into the blood stream via mucosal trauma, whereas inoculation of sterile tissues or spaces (eg, cysts) occurs from direct contact with a contaminated endoscope or endoscopic accessory. Contrast injection may also result in bacteria being introduced into a previously sterile space (eg, the biliary tree during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography).\nTo continue reading this article, you must sign in with your personal, hospital, or group practice subscription.\nSubscribe\nSign in\nDisclaimer: This generalized information is a limited summary of diagnosis, treatment, and/or medication information.

In the past, if no source of bleeding was found after an endoscopic evaluation, the bleeding was referred to as being \"obscure.\" However, more recently, it has been proposed that the term obscure only be used if patients have not had a source of bleeding identified after a thorough examination of the entire gastrointestinal tract, including the small bowel [2]. Most cases of what was previously referred to as obscure bleeding are more correctly categorized as suspected small bowel bleeding.\nSmall bowel bleeding may either be occult or overt:\n\u25cf\nOccult bleeding refers to a positive fecal occult blood test result that may or may not be associated with iron deficiency anemia when there is no evidence of visible blood loss to the patient or clinician.\n\u25cf\nOvert bleeding refers to bleeding that is visible to the patient or clinician. Overt bleeding may manifest as melena, hematochezia, or rarely in the case of small bowel bleeding, hematemesis.\nThe evaluation of patients with suspected small bowel bleeding will be reviewed here. The initial evaluation of patients with gastrointestinal bleeding is discussed separately.

Other sites of cancer include the ovary, stomach, small bowel, pancreatobiliary system, genitourinary system (urothelial cancer), prostate, brain, and skin [3-12]. There may also be an increased risk of breast cancer in individuals with Lynch syndrome (table 1) [7,13-20].\nThis topic will review recommendations for screening and surveillance of individuals with Lynch syndrome and their families.

However, most complications occur in the setting of polypectomy (eg, bleeding, perforation). Postpolypectomy coagulation syndrome (also known as postpolypectomy syndrome, postpolypectomy electrocoagulation syndrome, and transmural burn syndrome) refers to the development of abdominal pain, fever, leukocytosis, and peritoneal inflammation in the absence of bowel perforation after polypectomy with electrocoagulation.

Several agents have been described that can broadly be categorized as absorptive (vital) stains, contrast stains, and reactive stains (table 1). Absorptive stains (eg, Lugol's solution and methylene blue) diffuse or are preferentially absorbed across specific epithelial cell membranes. Contrast stains (eg, methylene blue) highlight surface topography and mucosal irregularities by permeating mucosal crevices. Reactive stains (eg, Congo red and phenol red) undergo chemical reactions with specific cellular constituents, resulting in a color change. The stains used for chromoendoscopy are transient, unlike the stains used to tattoo lesions. (See \"Tattooing and other methods for localizing gastrointestinal lesions\", section on 'Tattooing'.)\nChromoendoscopy has been applied in a variety of clinical settings and throughout the gastrointestinal tract. Interest in chromoendoscopy increased with the development of technologies such as endoscopic mucosal resection and photodynamic therapy that require precise visual tissue characterization. In addition, chromoendoscopy is being used in conjunction with other advances in endoscopic imaging, such as magnification endoscopy, confocal endomicroscopy, and confocal endocytoscopy. (See \"Magnification endoscopy\" and \"Confocal laser endomicroscopy and endocytoscopy\".)\nCompared with other evolving diagnostic modalities, such as fluorescence spectroscopy, fluorescence endoscopy, and optical coherence tomography, the equipment needed for chromoendoscopy is widely available. Furthermore, the techniques are simple, quick, inexpensive, and safe. However, the interpretation of the findings is not always straightforward, and, like many endoscopic techniques, the impact of chromoendoscopy on clinical outcomes relative to standard endoscopic and histologic methods has not been established in large controlled trials.\nThis topic will review chromoendoscopy, which generally refers to the application of stains or pigments by spraying through a catheter. Endoscopic tattooing (the injection of dye through a needle to mark a site for future identification), narrow band imaging, and magnification endoscopy are discussed separately. (See \"Tattooing and other methods for localizing gastrointestinal lesions\", section on 'Tattooing' and \"Barrett's esophagus: Evaluation with optical chromoscopy\" and \"Magnification endoscopy\".)\nINDICATIONS\nThe role of chromoendoscopy as a surveillance technique for specific conditions (eg, Barrett's esophagus, inflammatory bowel disease) is discussed separately [2].

At the same time, some endoscopic interventions may have bleeding risks that are increased by the antiplatelet agent given for thromboembolism prevention.

(See \"Management of anticoagulants in patients undergoing endoscopic procedures\" and \"Gastrointestinal endoscopy in patients with disorders of hemostasis\".)\nThe therapeutic effect of antiplatelet agents is impaired platelet function, including preventing platelet activation and inhibiting platelet aggregation. The mechanism of action of aspirin in low doses is inhibition of cyclooxygenase and platelet generation of thromboxane A2, resulting in an antithrombotic effect. Clopidogrel, ticlopidine, ticagrelor, and prasugrel inhibit platelet function by binding to the P2Y12 component of the adenosine diphosphate receptors which prevents activation of the GPIIb/IIIa receptor complex, thus reducing platelet aggregation. Aspirin, clopidogrel, ticlopidine, or prasugrel irreversibly inhibit platelet function for 7 to 10 days, corresponding to the average lifespan of platelets. The mechanism of action of antiplatelet agents is discussed in more detail separately. (See \"Platelet biology and mechanism of anti-platelet drugs\", section on 'Platelet receptors and their agonists'.)\nThe American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) has issued guidelines regarding the management of patients taking antiplatelet agents based upon the available evidence and consensus opinion [1].

The latter is particularly concerning since large polyps have an increased risk of harboring invasive carcinoma [1-5]. Endoscopic resection of large polyps, especially laterally spreading sessile polyps, is also more time-consuming and requires more resources compared with polypectomy of smaller lesions [6].\nBecause of these issues, surgical resection has historically played a dominant role, particularly for large sessile polyps and for those in locations that are difficult to manage endoscopically. However, advances in endoscopic resection technique and tools have enabled high success rates for removing large polyps [1-5,7]. Thus, most patients can avoid surgery.  \nThis topic will review endoscopic removal of large colon polyps. The definition of \"large\" varies in the literature; for the purpose of this discussion, the definition of large will refer to polyps that are \u22652 cm in their greatest dimension. An overview of colonoscopy, colorectal polyps, and the treatment and prevention of postpolypectomy bleeding are discussed separately. (See \"Overview of colonoscopy in adults\" and \"Overview of colon polyps\" and \"Management and prevention of bleeding after colonoscopy with polypectomy\".)\nDEFINITIONS\nA polyp refers to a protuberance into the lumen above the surrounding colonic mucosa. The Paris classification of superficial neoplastic lesions of the gastrointestinal tract has created some confusion in that it distinguishes lesions that are \"polypoid\" and \"nonpolypoid\" lesions (figure 1 and table 1). Accordingly, the term \"polyp\" should technically be replaced with \"lesion,\" but colloquial use of \"polyp\" makes this difficult. The term \"superficial\" indicates that there are no endoscopic features of invasive malignancy. \"Superficial\" is not equivalent to \"early,\" which may have features of invasive malignancy, but without lymph node metastases. The endoscopic features of polyps are discussed separately. (See \"Overview of colon polyps\", section on 'Clinical features'.)\nThe term \"laterally spreading tumor\" (LST) is used to describe a large, flat neoplastic lesion with a diameter beyond 10 mm growing laterally along the surface of the bowel [8]. LSTs are by definition nonpolypoid but may have mixed polypoid components.\nTo continue reading this article, you must sign in with your personal, hospital, or group practice subscription.\nSubscribe\nSign in\nDisclaimer: This generalized information is a limited summary of diagnosis, treatment, and/or medication information.

The early clips were cumbersome and difficult to use, complicated by frequent misfire rates and technical difficulties in positioning the clip during endoscopy. However, their use spread rapidly through Japan initially and then in Europe. More recently, endoscopic clipping technology has also gained greater acceptance in the United States.\nEndoscopic clips are used widely not only for the treatment of gastrointestinal bleeding but also for a variety of other gastrointestinal problems. In this review, we will describe the various clips currently available along with basic principles of clip application. The practical aspects of particular applications and the evidence supporting their role will also be presented.\nAVAILABLE CLIPS\nThe most recent iterations of endoscopic clips are a marked improvement over earlier models. They are available in multiple sizes and some can be rotated or reopened while being deployed through the endoscope [3,4]. Four companies produce disposable endoscopic clips for use in the United States market.\n\u25cf\nOlympus USA, Corp. produces the QuickClip2, which is a rotatable clip device (picture 1). These devices are produced in two sizes, 8 mm or 12 mm in width when opened and 165 cm to 230 cm in length, allowing deployment through a colonoscope.\n\u25cf\nBoston Scientific, Inc. produces the Resolution Clip, which cannot be rotated but can be reopened after closure if repositioning is required (picture 2). The Resolution Clip has an opening width of 11 mm and is available in lengths of 165 cm and 235 cm.\nTo continue reading this article, you must sign in with your personal, hospital, or group practice subscription.\nSubscribe\nSign in\nDisclaimer: This generalized information is a limited summary of diagnosis, treatment, and/or medication information.

Clinical manifestations depend somewhat on the organ affected and the nature of the contents released (gas, succus entericus, stool), as well as the ability of the surrounding tissues to contain those contents.\nIntestinal perforation can present acutely or in an indolent manner (eg, abscess or intestinal fistula formation). A confirmatory diagnosis is made primarily using abdominal imaging studies, but on occasion, exploration of the abdomen (open or laparoscopic) may be needed to make a diagnosis. Specific treatment depends upon the nature of the disease process that caused the perforation. Some etiologies are amenable to a nonoperative approach, while others will require surgery.\nAn overview of the clinical features, diagnosis, and management of the patient with alimentary tract perforation is reviewed here. Specific etiologies are briefly reviewed below and discussed in the linked topic reviews in more detail. (See 'Risk factors' below and 'Specific organs' below.)\nGENERAL PRINCIPLES\nPathophysiology \u2014 Perforation requires full-thickness injury of the bowel wall; however, partial-thickness bowel injury (eg, electrocautery, blunt trauma) can progress over time to become a full-thickness injury or perforation, subsequently releasing gastrointestinal contents.\nFull-thickness injury and subsequent perforation of the gastrointestinal tract can be due to a variety of etiologies, including:\nTo continue reading this article, you must sign in with your personal, hospital, or group practice subscription.\nSubscribe\nSign in\nDisclaimer: This generalized information is a limited summary of diagnosis, treatment, and/or medication information.

The initial evaluation of patients with acute upper GI bleeding involves an assessment of hemodynamic stability and resuscitation if necessary. Diagnostic studies (usually endoscopy) follow, with the goals of diagnosis, and when possible, treatment of the specific disorder.\nThe diagnostic and initial therapeutic approach to patients with acute upper GI bleeding will be reviewed here. While there is variability among guidelines, this approach is generally consistent with a multidisciplinary international consensus statement updated in 2019, a 2012 guideline issued by the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, a 2021 guideline issued by the American College of Gastroenterology, a 2015 guideline issued by the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, and a 2021 update issued by the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy [1-5]. The causes of upper GI bleeding, the endoscopic management of acute upper GI bleeding, and the management of active variceal hemorrhage are discussed separately. (See \"Causes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in adults\" and \"Overview of the treatment of bleeding peptic ulcers\" and \"Overview of the management of patients with variceal bleeding\" and \"Methods to achieve hemostasis in patients with acute variceal hemorrhage\".)\nA table outlining the major causes, clinical features, and emergency management of acute severe upper gastrointestinal bleeding in adults is provided (table 1).\nINITIAL EVALUATION\nThe initial evaluation of a patient with acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding includes a history, physical examination, and laboratory tests. The goal of the evaluation is to assess the severity of the bleeding, identify potential sources of the bleeding, and determine if there are conditions present that may affect subsequent management. The information gathered as part of the initial evaluation is used to guide decisions regarding triage, resuscitation, empiric medical therapy, and diagnostic testing.\nFactors that are predictive of bleeding coming from an upper GI source identified in a meta-analysis included a patient-reported history of melena (likelihood ratio [LR] 5.1-5.9), melenic stool on examination (LR 25), blood or coffee grounds detected during nasogastric lavage (LR 9.6), and a ratio of blood urea nitrogen to serum creatinine greater than 30 (LR 7.5) [6]. On the other hand, the presence of blood clots in the stool made an upper GI source less likely (LR 0.05). Factors associated with severe bleeding included red blood detected during nasogastric lavage (LR 3.1), tachycardia (LR 4.9), or a hemoglobin level of less than 8 g/dL (LR 4.5-6.2).\nTo continue reading this article, you must sign in with your personal, hospital, or group practice subscription.\nSubscribe\nSign in\nDisclaimer: This generalized information is a limited summary of diagnosis, treatment, and/or medication information.

(See \"Peutz-Jeghers syndrome: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management\" and \"PTEN hamartoma tumor syndromes, including Cowden syndrome\" and \"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of familial adenomatous polyposis\" and \"MUTYH-associated polyposis\".)\nEPIDEMIOLOGY\nJPS is rare, with an estimated incidence of 1 in 100,000 to 1 in 160,000 individuals [1,5-8].\nGENETICS\nGenetic mutations \u2014 JPS is an autosomal dominant condition with incomplete penetrance [9]. JPS occurs as a result of germline mutations in the SMAD4 (MADH4) or bone morphogenetic protein receptor type-1A (BMPR1A) gene, which are related to the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signaling pathway [10,11]. Pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in SMAD4 or BMPR1A are identified in approximately 40 to 60 percent of JPS patients [6,12]. While 50 to 75 percent of patients have a family history of juvenile polyposis, approximately 25 to 50 percent of patients have de novo mutations [7,13,14].\nThe SMAD4 gene is located on chromosome 18q21.1 and encodes for a cytoplasmic mediator of the TGF-beta signaling pathway. SMAD4 forms heteromeric complexes with other proteins of the SMAD family, and these complexes then act within the nucleus [9,15]. The BMPR1A (ALK3) gene is located on chromosome 10q22-23 and encodes a serine/threonine kinase receptor protein that is also involved in the TGF-beta signaling pathway. Upon activation, BMPR1A phosphorylates SMAD family proteins [9].\nTo continue reading this article, you must sign in with your personal, hospital, or group practice subscription.\nSubscribe\nSign in\nDisclaimer: This generalized information is a limited summary of diagnosis, treatment, and/or medication information.

Patients usually present with mucoid diarrhea or rectal bleeding [1,2]. This topic will review the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of cap polyposis. The approach to patient with colorectal polyps and the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of other colorectal polyposis syndromes are discussed separately. (See \"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of familial adenomatous polyposis\" and \"Familial adenomatous polyposis: Screening and management of patients and families\" and \"Juvenile polyposis syndrome\".)\nEPIDEMIOLOGY\nCap polyposis is a rare condition. The exact incidence is unknown. Cap polyposis usually occurs during the fifth decade of life; however, cases have been reported in both males and females ranging from 11 months to 76 years of age [1,3-6].\nETIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS\nThe pathogenesis of cap polyposis is not well understood. Infection, mucosal ischemia, T cell-mediated inflammation, mechanical stimulation by abnormal bowel motility, and repeated trauma to the colonic mucosa caused by straining, have all been implicated in the pathogenesis.\nA possible association with mucosal prolapse syndrome (MPS) has been suggested based upon similar histologic features [7-9]. It is hypothesized that in patients with cap polyposis, abnormal colonic motility may result in mucosal prolapse at redundant transverse folds, resulting in local ischemia, recurrent mucosal trauma, and the development of polyps [10]. Cap polyposis has also been described following pelvic surgery [11]. Persistent mechanical stimulation due to mucosal prolapse may lead to mucosal hyperplasia resulting in hypersecretion of serum proteins into the lumen and a protein-losing enteropathy [12,13].\nAn infectious etiology has been proposed based in part upon symptomatic and endoscopic improvement after treatment of Helicobacter pylori with antibiotics [3,11,14,15]. However, H. pylori has not been isolated within the inflammatory colonic polyps. Postulated mechanisms by which gastric H. pylori causes extra-gastric cap polyposis include molecular mimicry and the release of inflammatory mediators. The role of altered intestinal microbiome (dysbiosis) has also been suggested in pathogenesis of cap polyposis. In one case study, antibiotic treatment lead to regression of cap polyposis through significant alterations in fecal microbiota composition [16].\nTo continue reading this article, you must sign in with your personal, hospital, or group practice subscription.\nSubscribe\nSign in\nDisclaimer: This generalized information is a limited summary of diagnosis, treatment, and/or medication information.

The majority of patients with PSC have underlying inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Patients with concurrent PSC and IBD have an increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) [1-6]. This topic review will focus on the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, diagnosis, and management of IBD in patients with PSC in addition to the risk of CRC and guidelines for CRC surveillance. CRC surveillance in patients with IBD is presented separately. (See \"Surveillance and management of dysplasia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease\".)\nINFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE\nEpidemiology \u2014 The prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) approaches 90 percent [7-10]. Ulcerative colitis (UC), Crohn disease, and indeterminate colitis of the colon account for 80, 10, and 10 percent, respectively [11]. (See \"Primary sclerosing cholangitis: Epidemiology and pathogenesis\", section on 'PSC and inflammatory bowel disease'.)\nClinical manifestations\nClinical features \u2014 Colitis in patients with PSC often presents at an earlier age as compared with patients with IBD alone [12]. The colitis usually has a mild or quiescent course. Patients are often asymptomatic but in rare cases present with rectal bleeding. Several studies have suggested that PSC-IBD is clinically distinct, with milder course, fewer clinical exacerbations, and lower need for biologic treatments but higher risk of colorectal neoplasia [13,14]. PSC-IBD is also associated with a greater prevalence of pancolitis, \"backwash ileitis,\" and rectal sparing [9]. (See \"Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and prognosis of ulcerative colitis in adults\", section on 'Colitis' and \"Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and prognosis of Crohn disease in adults\", section on 'Clinical features'.)\nFollowing colectomy, patients can present with stomal and peristomal variceal bleeding secondary to portal hypertension associated with PSC. Patients with proctocolectomy with ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) also have an increased risk of pouchitis [11,15,16]. Symptoms of pouchitis include increased stool frequency, urgency, abdominal cramps, pelvic pressure, tenesmus, and night-time fecal seepage to incontinence. (See \"Ileostomy or colostomy care and complications\", section on 'Stomal bleeding' and \"Pouchitis: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis\", section on 'Clinical features'.)\nThe course of colitis following liver transplantation for PSC is variable. Although the colitis may remain quiescent in some patients, other patients may have severe symptoms (10 or more stools per day with severe cramps and continuous bleeding) despite the immunosuppression used for the transplant [17-19]. Presence of IBD prior to liver transplantation does not appear to affect patient or graft survival [20]. A retrospective study found the 10-year cumulative probability of an IBD flare requiring additional therapy to be 26 percent, and the risk of new-onset IBD after liver transplantation was 25 percent [21].

Classic FAP is characterized by the presence of 100 or more adenomatous colorectal polyps. When fully developed, patients can have up to thousands of colorectal adenomas and a 100 percent risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). An attenuated form of FAP (AFAP) is characterized by few colorectal adenomas with a later age of onset and an 80 percent lifetime risk of CRC. Patients with FAP are also at risk for several extracolonic malignancies. This chapter will review the management of FAP. The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of FAP and other hereditary CRC syndromes are discussed separately. (See \"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of familial adenomatous polyposis\" and \"Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer): Cancer screening and management\" and \"MUTYH-associated polyposis\" and \"Juvenile polyposis syndrome\" and \"Peutz-Jeghers syndrome: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management\".)\nCANDIDATES FOR CANCER SCREENING\nScreening for tumors associated with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) should be performed in individuals with a pathogenic Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (APC) variant. Screening for FAP-associated cancers should also be performed in individuals at-risk for FAP who have either not undergone genetic evaluation or have indeterminate genetic test results.

The occurrence of an extremely high number of cases of Kaposi sarcoma (KS) was noted early in the AIDS epidemic and many of them had an unusually aggressive clinical course. KS was therefore included as an AIDS-defining illness in early case definitions from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and invasive cervical carcinoma were subsequently added as AIDS-defining conditions.\nSubsequently, the spectrum of neoplasia in patients living with HIV has changed as the use of potent antiretroviral therapy (ART) has become widespread (table 1). The incidence of KS and NHL has decreased markedly, but there has been a relative increase in malignancies that collectively are referred to as non-AIDS-defining cancers (NADCs) compared with the general population. NADCs are a major factor contributing to mortality in people living with HIV. [1]\nThis topic will review general management considerations for patients with HIV and a malignancy, as well as a discussion of specific malignancies. The epidemiology and pathogenesis of malignancy in people living with HIV are discussed separately. (See \"HIV infection and malignancy: Epidemiology and pathogenesis\", section on 'Introduction'.)\nCLINICAL IMPLICATIONS\nMalignancies in patients infected with HIV are often characterized by earlier age at onset, atypical pathology (higher tumor grade), more aggressive clinical behavior, and/or more advanced stage at presentation [2,3]. These features may have implications for screening and treatment, and may contribute to a poorer outcome, with rapid progression, a high rate of relapse, and a worse response to treatment.\nScreening and prevention \u2014 The increased incidence of selected cancers in patients living with HIV, combined with the younger age of onset and the altered biology, raise the question of whether more aggressive screening is indicated [3-6]. Most cancer screening guidelines do not make separate recommendations for individuals infected with HIV, with the exception of the European AIDS Clinical Society [7].\nTo continue reading this article, you must sign in with your personal, hospital, or group practice subscription.\nSubscribe\nSign in\nDisclaimer: This generalized information is a limited summary of diagnosis, treatment, and/or medication information.

The images can be further enhanced by the topical application of stains or pigments (enhanced magnification endoscopy or magnification chromoscopy).\nEquipment and experience with these approaches is evolving. A growing number of reports suggest that they offer the ability to improve diagnostic accuracy for a variety of gastrointestinal disorders [1]. In addition, newer technologies, such as confocal laser endomicroscopy and endocytoscopy, are allowing for real-time visualization of the gastrointestinal tract at a microscopic level [2-4].\nMagnification endoscopy will be reviewed here. Other methods for enhanced visualization of the gastrointestinal mucosa are discussed elsewhere. (See \"Chromoendoscopy\" and \"Barrett's esophagus: Evaluation with optical chromoscopy\".)\nEQUIPMENT\nMagnification endoscopes include an adjustable focusing mechanism that permits standard endoscopic views and the ability to enlarge the image. Most magnification endoscopes combine optical and digital zoom and permit 1.5 to 2 times digital magnification and/or an optical magnification up to 150 times [5,6]. Some magnification endoscopes provide near-focus imaging, which allows the endoscope to be moved closer (within 2 to 6 mm) to the area of interest while maintaining the images in focus and providing images with high magnification (>100 times).\nResolution is related to pixel density. Conventional endoscopes have pixel densities in the range of 100,000 to 200,000. By contrast, the available magnification endoscopes have pixel densities from 850,000 to more than 1 million, allowing them to discriminate objects that are only 10 to 71 microns in diameter [1,6].\nTo continue reading this article, you must sign in with your personal, hospital, or group practice subscription.\nSubscribe\nSign in\nDisclaimer: This generalized information is a limited summary of diagnosis, treatment, and/or medication information.

Some are present from birth or develop as part of inherited syndromes, but the vast majority are acquired later in life. The reasons for the distortion of vascular structures observed with advancing age are poorly understood.\nInconsistent taxonomy of vascular anomalies in the GI tract, along with a common presentation of GI bleeding from different vascular abnormalities, has led to significant confusion in the medical literature [1]. The diagnosis of a vascular anomaly can be based upon endoscopic findings, histologic characteristics, or association with systemic diseases.\nVascular anomalies can be divided into three broad categories:\n\u25cf\nVascular tumors or angiomas, which can be benign (such as hemangiomas) or malignant (such as Kaposi sarcoma or angiosarcoma).\n\u25cf\nVascular anomalies associated with congenital or systemic diseases such as blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome, Klippel-Tr\u00e9naunay-Weber syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, the CREST variant of scleroderma, and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasias (Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome).\nTo continue reading this article, you must sign in with your personal, hospital, or group practice subscription.\nSubscribe\nSign in\nDisclaimer: This generalized information is a limited summary of diagnosis, treatment, and/or medication information.

It can be related to acute arterial occlusion (embolic, thrombotic), venous thrombosis, or hypoperfusion of the mesenteric vasculature causing nonocclusive ischemia. The incidence is estimated at 16 cases per 100,000 person-years, which has increased over time [2].\nColonic ischemia is the most frequent form of intestinal ischemia, most often affecting older adults [3]. Colonic ischemia may be more prevalent in females. Colonic ischemia should be suspected in patients with lower abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea or hematochezia; however, these symptoms are nonspecific.\nApproximately 15 percent of patients with colonic ischemia develop necrotic bowel, the consequences of which can be life-threatening, making rapid diagnosis and treatment imperative. Most cases of colonic ischemia are usually transient and resolve without sequelae [4]. However, some patients will have a more prolonged course or develop long-term complications, such as stricture or chronic ischemic colitis.\nThe diagnosis and treatment of colonic ischemia can be challenging since it often occurs in patients who are debilitated and have multiple medical problems. The clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of ischemia affecting the colon, including acute colonic ischemia and chronic ischemic colitis (which sometimes affects the rectum), will be reviewed here. Acute and chronic intestinal ischemia of the small intestine are discussed separately. (See \"Overview of intestinal ischemia in adults\" and \"Chronic mesenteric ischemia\".)\nCOLON ANATOMY AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY\nColonic ischemia is usually the result of a sudden, but usually transient, reduction in blood flow, the effects of which are particularly prominent at the \"watershed\" regions of the colon, where collateral blood flow is limited.\nTo continue reading this article, you must sign in with your personal, hospital, or group practice subscription.\nSubscribe\nSign in\nDisclaimer: This generalized information is a limited summary of diagnosis, treatment, and/or medication information.

Symptoms of constipation include hard stools, excessive straining, infrequent bowel movements (<3 per week), a sense of incomplete evacuation, or the use of manual maneuvers to facilitate defecation. Symptoms which last >3 months are considered chronic.\nThe etiology, and evaluation of chronic constipation will be reviewed here. The management of chronic constipation is discussed separately. The recommendations in this topic are largely consistent with guidelines from the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) and American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy [4,5]. (See \"Management of chronic constipation in adults\".)\nEPIDEMIOLOGY\nEstimates of the prevalence of chronic constipation in North America have ranged from 12 to 19 percent [6,7]. Self-reported constipation appears to be more prevalent in females and those over age 60. It is more prevalent in individuals with little daily physical activity, lower income, and poor education [8]. In a meta-analysis of 26 studies, the pooled prevalence of chronic constipation in females was almost twofold that in males (17.4 versus 9.2 percent, OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.87-2.62) [7].\nThe prevalence of chronic constipation increases with age, most dramatically in patients 65 years of age or older [6,9,10]. In this age group, approximately 26 percent of males and 34 percent of females have symptoms of constipation [10,11]. Constipation appears to correlate with decreased caloric intake in older adults but not with either fluid or fiber intake [8,12,13]. (See \"Constipation in the older adult\", section on 'Epidemiology and risk factors'.)\nIn one study of 277 patients with chronic symptoms of constipation, 71 percent were due to irritable bowel syndrome [14]. Dyssynergic defecation, slow transit constipation, or a combination of the two were responsible for 13, 11, and 5 percent, respectively.

Affected patients have multiple colorectal adenomas and an increased risk for developing colorectal cancer. This topic will review the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of MUTYH-associated polyposis. The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of familial adenomatous polyposis, Lynch syndrome, and hamartomatous polyposis syndromes are discussed elsewhere. (See \"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of familial adenomatous polyposis\" and \"Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer): Cancer screening and management\" and \"Juvenile polyposis syndrome\".)\nGENETICS\nMUTYH-associated polyposis is an autosomal recessive polyposis syndrome caused by biallelic pathogenic germline variants in the MUTYH gene [1]. MUTYH is a base excision repair gene whose protein repairs oxidative damage to the DNA. Oxidation of guanine leads to the formation of 8-oxo-6, 7, 8-dihydroxy-2 deoxyguanosine. Failure of base excision repair results in mispairing of this nucleotide with adenine and resultant somatic CG\u2013AT transversions in multiple genes, including the APC and KRAS genes. The target genes that are mutated as a consequence of oxidative damage strongly influence the polyposis phenotype [2].\nThe two most common MUTYH gene pathogenic variants in Western Europeans and North Americans are Y179C and G396D (previously referred to as Y165C and G382D, respectively) [3]. However, pathogenic germline variants have been reported at other loci, and the prevalence of specific variants differs by ethnicity of the population [4-8]. Patients with MUTYH-associated polyposis may be homozygous or compound heterozygous for pathogenic germline variants in the MUTYH gene.\nEPIDEMIOLOGY\nApproximately 1 to 2 percent of the general population carry a single (monoallelic) germline MUTYH pathogenic variant, with two (biallelic) pathogenic variants identified in <1 percent of individuals diagnosed with colorectal cancer [9]. Among individuals with multiple colorectal adenomas in whom an APC mutation has been excluded, biallelic MUTYH pathogenic variants are found in 7 to 13 percent of patients with >100 adenomas and in 14 to 40 percent of patients with 10 to 99 adenomas [1,10-13].\nCLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS\nMUTYH-associated polyposis is typically characterized by the presence of multiple colorectal adenomas; however, the phenotype can vary based on the genotype. In addition, environmental and epigenetic factors may also affect the MUTYH-associated polyposis phenotype [14]. A number of extracolonic manifestations have also been associated with MUTYH-associated polyposis.

Early diagnosis of factitious diarrhea can prevent patient self-harm as well as iatrogenic complications arising from unnecessary tests and treatments. This topic will review the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of factitious diarrhea. Other causes of chronic diarrhea and the clinical features, diagnosis, and management of factitious disorder are discussed separately. (See \"Approach to the adult with chronic diarrhea in resource-abundant settings\" and \"Factitious disorder imposed on self (Munchausen syndrome)\".)\nEPIDEMIOLOGY\nMore than 90 percent of patients with factitious diarrhea are women and have a history of work in the healthcare field [1]. These patients often seek care from many clinicians and have multiple hospital admissions in an effort to establish the cause of the diarrhea. They also have a higher incidence of anorexia nervosa, suggesting a common underlying psychiatric basis [2,3].\nSurreptitious laxative misuse is the most frequent cause of factitious diarrhea and often presents as chronic watery diarrhea of unknown etiology. In one study in which 47 patients at a tertiary referral center for evaluation of diarrhea of unclear etiology were screened for laxative use, seven patients (15 percent) tested positive for laxatives [4].\nCLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS\nClinical presentation \u2014 Patients with factitious diarrhea often present with a history of frequent, large-volume, watery diarrhea [5,6]. Patients report between 10 and 20 bowel movements a day, with 24-hour stool volumes ranging from 300 to 3000 mL. More than 50 percent of patients complain of nocturnal bowel movements. Patients may also report associated blood in the stool.\nIn patients with factious diarrhea due to laxatives, diarrhea is often associated with cramping abdominal pain due to an increase in the fluid content of the stool and enhanced gastrointestinal motility. Lethargy, generalized weakness, and dizziness or lightheadedness may result from orthostatic hypotension due to dehydration. Weight loss is common, and in severe cases, patients may have malnutrition and cachexia due to diarrhea, concurrent nausea or vomiting, or diminished nutrient absorption. As an example, rhein (an anthraquinone) and bisacodyl (a diphenolic laxative) impair glucose absorption and may also cause mild steatorrhea and gastrointestinal protein loss.

The vast majority of these are adenocarcinomas. Primary rectal squamous cell carcinomas, which are very rare, can be difficult to distinguish from anal cancers and are treated according to the same approach as anal cancer, with initial chemoradiotherapy (CRT; radiotherapy with concurrent fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy) rather than surgery. (See \"Treatment of anal cancer\", section on 'Rectal squamous cell cancers'.)\nThe optimal approach to treating rectal adenocarcinoma depends on several factors, of which the location in the rectum and the local disease extent are most important. For some patients with limited invasive cancer in a polyp who have no adverse features, polypectomy alone may suffice. At the other end of the spectrum, for others who have locally extensive, fixed, bulky tumors; extensive nodal disease; or extramural venous invasion on staging MRI a \"total neoadjuvant approach\" that includes four months of upfront chemotherapy and either long-course CRT or short-course radiotherapy prior to surgery may be pursued. (See 'Clinical T4, N2 disease, or other high-risk features' below.)\nThis topic review will provide an overview of the treatment for rectal cancer. Neoadjuvant CRT for potentially resectable adenocarcinomas, adjuvant therapy after resection of a primary rectal adenocarcinoma, staging and the staging workup, pretreatment local staging evaluation, surgical principles, and recommendations for post-treatment surveillance are discussed elsewhere, as is the management of rectal squamous cell cancers. (See \"Neoadjuvant therapy for rectal adenocarcinoma\" and \"Adjuvant therapy for resected rectal adenocarcinoma in patients not receiving neoadjuvant therapy\" and \"Pretreatment local staging evaluation for rectal cancer\" and \"Radical resection of rectal cancer\" and \"Post-treatment surveillance for colorectal cancer\" and \"Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and staging of colorectal cancer\", section on 'Staging' and \"Treatment of anal cancer\", section on 'Rectal squamous cell cancers'.)\nDIAGNOSIS AND STAGING\nMost patients with rectal adenocarcinoma are diagnosed by colonoscopy after presenting with lower gastrointestinal tract bleeding; in some, the diagnosis is made by finding a lesion during a routine screening colonoscopy or incidentally on an imaging study performed for another reason. (See \"Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and staging of colorectal cancer\", section on 'Clinical presentation'.)\nWhen viewed through the endoscope, the vast majority of rectal cancers are endoluminal masses that arise from the mucosa and protrude into the lumen. The mass may be exophytic or polypoid. Bleeding (oozing or frank bleeding) may be seen with lesions that are friable, necrotic, or ulcerated. A minority of neoplastic lesions are nonpolypoid and relatively flat or depressed.\nTo continue reading this article, you must sign in with your personal, hospital, or group practice subscription.\nSubscribe\nSign in\nDisclaimer: This generalized information is a limited summary of diagnosis, treatment, and/or medication information.

However, a specific diagnosis can be achieved in more than 90 percent of patients.\nThis topic review will provide an overview of the evaluation and treatment of chronic diarrhea. Individual disorders associated with chronic diarrhea and an approach to patients with acute diarrhea are presented separately. (See \"Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical manifestations of celiac disease in adults\" and \"Microscopic (lymphocytic and collagenous) colitis: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management\" and \"Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and prognosis of ulcerative colitis in adults\" and \"Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and prognosis of Crohn disease in adults\" and \"Evaluation of the patient with HIV and diarrhea\" and \"Approach to the adult with acute diarrhea in resource-abundant settings\".)\nDEFINITION\nChronic diarrhea is defined as a persistent alteration of stool consistency from the norm with loose stools (consistency between types 5 and 7 on the Bristol stool chart) and increased stool frequency of greater than three stools daily of at least four weeks' duration [3-7].\nEPIDEMIOLOGY\nThe prevalence of chronic diarrhea in the general population in resource-abundant settings has not been well established. The variable rates observed in several studies reflect differences in study design, definitions, and characteristics of populations that have been sampled. Based upon a commonly used definition (ie, the presence of excessive stool frequency) a reasonable approximation is that chronic diarrhea affects approximately 3 to 7 percent of the population [4,8,9]. Chronic diarrhea can decrease quality of life. However, accurate assessment of the degree to which this occurs has not been established. Direct and indirect costs of chronic diarrhea in the United States are not known precisely. Estimates ranging from $524 million per year and $136 million per year have been reported [10-12]. However, costs may be much higher when considering various diseases associated with chronic diarrhea, especially inflammatory bowel disease [13], and irritable bowel syndrome [14].\nETIOLOGY\nThe principal causes of diarrhea vary based upon the socioeconomic status of the population. In resource-abundant settings, common causes are irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), inflammatory bowel disease, malabsorption syndromes (such as lactose intolerance and celiac disease), and chronic infections (particularly in patients who are immunocompromised) (table 1). In resource-limited settings, chronic diarrhea is frequently caused by chronic bacterial, mycobacterial, and parasitic infections, although functional disorders, malabsorption, and inflammatory bowel disease are also common.\nTo continue reading this article, you must sign in with your personal, hospital, or group practice subscription.\nSubscribe\nSign in\nDisclaimer: This generalized information is a limited summary of diagnosis, treatment, and/or medication information.

A surgical resection is the only curative treatment modality for localized colon cancer. The goal of surgical resection of primary colon cancer is complete removal of the tumor, the major vascular pedicles, and the lymphatic drainage basin of the affected colonic segment [1]. En bloc resection of contiguous structures is indicated if there is attachment or infiltration of the tumor into a potentially resectable organ or structure. Patients with symptoms of complicated disease (eg, obstruction, perforation) may require a staged approach to resection.\nSurgical resection may also be indicated in selected patients with limited, potentially resectable metastatic disease (eg, in the liver or lung). (See \"Potentially resectable colorectal cancer liver metastases: Integration of surgery and chemotherapy\" and \"Surgical resection of pulmonary metastases: Benefits, indications, preoperative evaluation, and techniques\".)\nThe surgical management of the primary disease in patients with colon cancer is reviewed here. The epidemiology, clinical presentation, staging, and medical therapies used to treat colon cancer (eg, chemotherapy, radiation therapy), surgical treatment of metastatic disease, issues surrounding resection of the primary site in patients who present with metastatic disease, and prognosis following treatment of localized colon cancer are reviewed separately:\n\u25cf\n(See \"Epidemiology and risk factors for colorectal cancer\".)\n\u25cf\n(See \"Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and staging of colorectal cancer\".)\nTo continue reading this article, you must sign in with your personal, hospital, or group practice subscription.\nSubscribe\nSign in\nDisclaimer: This generalized information is a limited summary of diagnosis, treatment, and/or medication information.

Primary lymphomas of the GI tract are rare, while secondary GI involvement is relatively common. Despite their rarity, primary lymphomas of the GI tract are important since their evaluation, diagnosis, management, and prognosis are distinct from that of lymphoma at other sites and other cancers of the GI tract.\nThe definition of primary GI lymphoma has differed among authors, but typically refers to a lymphoma that predominantly involves any section of the GI tract from the oropharynx to the rectum [1,2]. While the disease typically involves a single primary site, multiple sites within the GI tract may be involved, as can local and distant lymph nodes. The vast majority are non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs), although Hodgkin lymphoma has been reported [3,4].\nGI lymphomas typically present with nonspecific signs and symptoms attributable to the site of involvement. This topic review will discuss the salient clinical features and diagnostic evaluation of GI lymphomas. The management of GI lymphoma is presented separately. (See \"Treatment of extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT lymphoma)\".)\nOVERVIEW\nDistribution \u2014 The GI tract is the predominant site of extranodal non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs) [5]. Primary NHLs of the GI tract are rare, accounting for only 1 to 4 percent of malignancies arising in the stomach, small intestine, or colon [6]. In contrast, secondary GI involvement is relatively common, occurring in approximately 10 percent of patients with limited stage NHL at the time of diagnosis, and up to 60 percent of those dying from advanced NHL [5,7]. (See \"Epidemiology and clinical features of small bowel neoplasms\".)\nThe two largest studies of GI lymphoma reported the following sites of involvement in Greek and German populations [8,9]:\nTo continue reading this article, you must sign in with your personal, hospital, or group practice subscription.\nSubscribe\nSign in\nDisclaimer: This generalized information is a limited summary of diagnosis, treatment, and/or medication information.

        "article_text": "View in\nLanguage\n Chinese\nEnglish\nAUTHOR:Michael Camilleri, MDSECTION EDITOR:Nicholas J Talley, MD, PhDDEPUTY EDITOR:Kristen M Robson, MD, MBA, FACG\nLiterature review current through: Sep 2024.\nThis topic last updated: May 23, 2024.\nINTRODUCTION\nAcute colonic pseudo-obstruction (Ogilvie's syndrome) is a disorder characterized by acute dilatation of the colon in the absence of an anatomic lesion that obstructs the flow of intestinal contents. Pseudo-obstruction is characterized by signs and symptoms of a mechanical obstruction of the small or large bowel in the absence of a mechanical cause. Pseudo-obstruction may be acute or chronic and is characterized by the presence of dilation of the bowel on imaging. Other causes of colonic distension, including toxic megacolon, mechanical obstruction, and chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction, are discussed in detail separately. (See \"Large bowel obstruction\" and \"Toxic megacolon\" and \"Chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction: Etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis\".)\nEPIDEMIOLOGY\nAcute colonic pseudo-obstruction usually involves the cecum and right colon, although occasionally colonic dilation extends to the rectum. Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction appears to be more common in males and in patients over the age of 60 years [1]. However, cases have been reported in children [2]. Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction is a rare complication of surgery, occurring in 0.06 percent of patients after cardiac surgery and 0.7 to 1.3 percent of patients with burns and after orthopedic surgery [3,4]. In surgical patients, symptoms usually present at an average of five days postoperatively. From a national hospital admissions database, the estimated incidence of acute colonic pseudo-obstruction was approximately 100 cases out of 100,000 inpatient admissions per year [5].\nETIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS\nAcute colonic pseudo-obstruction usually occurs in hospitalized patients or in those residing in a long-term care facility, in association with a severe illness or after surgery, and in conjunction with a metabolic imbalance or culprit medication (table 1) [1,3,6-8]. In a large, retrospective series that included 400 patients with acute colonic pseudo-obstruction, the most common predisposing conditions were nonoperative trauma, infection, and cardiac disease, each of which were associated with 10 percent of cases [1]. In this series, cesarean section and hip surgery were the most common surgical procedures associated with acute colonic pseudo-obstruction. In a systematic review of 125 postpartum cases of acute colonic pseudo-obstruction, 62 (92 percent) occurred following cesarean section for diverse indications including preeclampsia, multiple pregnancy, and antepartum hemorrhage/placenta previa [9]. No specific risk factors could be identified for postpartum acute colonic pseudo-obstruction. Gynecologic cancers and benign gynecologic conditions were also associated with acute colonic pseudo-obstruction, most often postoperatively [10].\nAcute colonic pseudo-obstruction is also well-documented after kidney transplantation, and possible contributing factors include obesity, cumulative dose of prednisone received, and mycophenolate mofetil [11]. Rare cases have been reported in association with atrophic visceral myopathy with an extremely thin colonic wall, atrophic circular and longitudinal muscularis propria without inflammation or fibrosis, and unaffected ganglion cells and myenteric plexus [12]. The cause of the smooth muscle atrophy was unclear, and the only potential association was with prior hypothyroidism [12,13].\nAcute colonic pseudo-obstruction has been rarely associated with herpes zoster infection [14], pheochromocytoma [15], coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [16], HIV infection [17], and antipsychotic medications. In a series of five patients with severe COVID-19, the mean time from onset of symptoms to developing acute colonic pseudo-obstruction was approximately 34 days, and the mean duration of illness was approximately 25 days. Colonic decompression was performed in two patients [16].\nTo continue reading this article, you must sign in with your personal, hospital, or group practice subscription.\nSubscribe\nSign in\nDisclaimer: This generalized information is a limited summary of diagnosis, treatment, and/or medication information.

Diarrhea is also an independent predictor of reduced quality of life and, in the case of advanced HIV disease, increased mortality [1].\nThe approach to the evaluation of diarrhea will be discussed here. For detailed information about specific pathogens, please see appropriate topic reviews. (See \"AIDS-related cytomegalovirus gastrointestinal disease\" and \"Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infections in persons with HIV\".)\nINCIDENCE\n\u25cf\nUnited States \u2013 Prior to the use of effective combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) in the United States, chronic diarrhea (defined as four or more weeks of diarrhea) was responsible for 17 percent of the new AIDS diagnoses reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [2]. (See \"The natural history and clinical features of HIV infection in adults and adolescents\", section on 'AIDS and advanced HIV infection'.)\nHowever, with the widespread use of ART, the incidence of infectious causes of diarrhea in patients with HIV and low CD4 counts (<200 cells/microL) has declined [3]. Experience at a single center between 1995 and 1997 found that, while the incidence of diarrhea remained constant, infectious etiologies declined from 53 to 13 percent [4]. In another study that followed a cohort of approximately 600 patients in the Boston area after the introduction of combination ART, chronic diarrhea was reported in 28 percent and severe diarrhea (defined as more than six stools per day) in 3 percent [5]. In this study, stool pathogens were found in only 12 percent of the population.\nAlthough the incidence of infectious diarrhea has decreased, antiretroviral-associated diarrhea may occur, the frequency depends upon the specific ART regimen (see 'Exposures' below). Medication-induced diarrhea is a leading diagnostic consideration when diarrhea is the sole complaint [6], particularly when there is a temporal association. In addition, when an infectious etiology is not ascertained in advanced disease, then HIV-associated enteropathy needs to be considered.\nTo continue reading this article, you must sign in with your personal, hospital, or group practice subscription.\nSubscribe\nSign in\nDisclaimer: This generalized information is a limited summary of diagnosis, treatment, and/or medication information.

These disorders have distinct pathologic and clinical characteristics (table 1), but their pathogenesis remains poorly understood. (See \"Definitions, epidemiology, and risk factors for inflammatory bowel disease\".)\nApproximately 20 percent of patients with CD and 12 percent of those with UC develop symptoms before 20 years of age [1]. The development of IBD early in life has implications that are not encountered in adults. Clinicians caring for children and adolescents with CD or UC not only must treat the underlying disease and its complications but must also carefully monitor linear growth, skeletal development, and puberty, as well as how the child's maturation and psychological health are affected by living with a chronic disease. In addition, some therapies used for older patients present more challenges for children because many children are unable to swallow pills or are unwilling to use rectal/topical therapy.\nThe treatment of UC in children and adolescents is reviewed here.

The choice of treatment is determined by a variety of factors, including patient preference, clinician judgment, and resource availability.

Observational data indicate that as monotherapy, brachytherapy has similar efficacy compared with other forms of radiation and is comparable with other modalities (eg, surgery) in the treatment of low-risk prostate cancer, and it has an important role in combination with external beam RT in the management of some patients with intermediate- and high-risk disease.\nThe techniques and complications of brachytherapy, along with relevant aspects of patient selection, are reviewed here.

It colonizes the human intestinal tract typically after the normal gut flora has been disrupted (frequently in association with antibiotic therapy). C. difficile infection (CDI) is one of the most common health care-associated infections and a significant cause of morbidity and mortality, especially among older adult hospitalized patients.\nThe clinical manifestations and diagnosis of CDI will be reviewed here. The treatment, epidemiology, and prevention of CDI are discussed separately. (See \"Clostridioides difficile infection in adults: Treatment and prevention\" and \"Clostridioides difficile infection in adults: Epidemiology, microbiology, and pathophysiology\" and \"Clostridioides difficile infection: Prevention and control\".)\nCDI in children is also discussed separately.

The basis for this range of clinical manifestations is not fully understood but may be related to host and pathogen factors. (See \"Clostridioides difficile infection in adults: Epidemiology, microbiology, and pathophysiology\".)\nTiming of symptom onset \u2014 Symptoms of CDI typically, but not always, occur in the setting of antibiotic therapy (table 1). Symptoms of CDI may begin during or after antibiotic therapy, and most cases occur within two weeks of antibiotic therapy. Rarely, symptoms present as late as 10 weeks after cessation of antibiotic therapy [5]. However, a lack of antibiotic use does not rule out the possibility of CDI. In one study, approximately 30 percent of patients with community-acquired CDI had not been exposed to antibiotics [6]. Additional risk factors for CDI include age >65, recent hospitalization, and use of proton-pump inhibitors.

The defining clinical feature of PHTS is the presence of hamartomatous tumors, which are disorganized growths of native cells in native tissues. PHTS is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion.\nPHENOTYPIC SPECTRUM OF PHTS\nOnce thought to be distinct genetic syndromes, the different clinical presentations of PHTS illustrate the heterogenous clinical spectrum and phenotypic overlap associated with germline PTEN pathogenic variants. The phenotypic spectrum of PHTS includes the following entities:\n\u25cf\nCowden syndrome (also known as Cowden disease or multiple hamartoma syndrome) is the best-described phenotype within PHTS. Besides multiple hamartomas in a variety of tissues, patients have characteristic dermatologic manifestations such as trichilemmomas, oral fibromas, and punctate palmoplantar keratoses, and an increased risk of breast, endometrial, thyroid, kidney, and colorectal cancers as well as melanoma.\n\u25cf\nBannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome is another rare subset of PHTS. In addition to hamartomas, these patients have multiple subcutaneous lipomas, macrocephaly, and penile lentigines (picture 1). High penetrance of cancer, as reported in Cowden syndrome, has not been as clearly documented, but is presumed to be present.\nGenotype analyses have concluded that a similar spectrum of pathogenic variants in the PTEN gene is found in the Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome as in other PHTS, leading to the conclusion that they are related allelic disorders [1-3]. Both conditions are now considered phenotypically distinct, age-related presentations of a similar genetic abnormality [4,5].\nTo continue reading this article, you must sign in with your personal, hospital, or group practice subscription.\nSubscribe\nSign in\nDisclaimer: This generalized information is a limited summary of diagnosis, treatment, and/or medication information.

Intramural gas can also affect the stomach, but this condition is referred to as gastric pneumatosis [1]. Since its first description, PI has appeared in the literature under many names, including pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis, intramural gas, pneumatosis coli, pseudolipomatosis, intestinal emphysema, bullous emphysema of the intestine, and lymphopneumatosis [2,3]. PI can also be associated with pneumoperitoneum or free air in the peritoneal cavity.\nThe pathogenesis of PI is poorly understood and is probably multifactorial. In some cases, PI is an incidental finding associated with a benign etiology, whereas in others, it portends a life-threatening intra-abdominal condition. As a result of the wide array of clinical settings in which PI is encountered, its implications are often misinterpreted. This topic will review the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, evaluation, and management of PI. The clinical features of necrotizing enterocolitis, an important cause of PI in newborns, is discussed in detail separately. (See \"Neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis: Clinical features and diagnosis\".)\nEPIDEMIOLOGY\nThe incidence of pneumatosis intestinalis (PI) is difficult to ascertain since most patients are asymptomatic and never come to clinical attention [3]. Adults are typically diagnosed in the fifth to eighth decade. (See \"Neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis: Clinical features and diagnosis\".)\nETIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS\nPneumatosis intestinalis (PI) is idiopathic (15 percent) or secondary (85 percent) to a wide variety of gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal illnesses (table 1) [4,5]. The majority of cases in infants are secondary to necrotizing enterocolitis. (See \"Neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis: Clinical features and diagnosis\".)  \nNumerous hypotheses have been proposed to explain the pathogenesis of PI, including mechanical, bacterial, and biochemical causes. Although the theories are distinctly different, they are not necessarily mutually exclusive. It is likely that multiple pathogenic mechanisms are involved in the formation of PI.\nTo continue reading this article, you must sign in with your personal, hospital, or group practice subscription.\nSubscribe\nSign in\nDisclaimer: This generalized information is a limited summary of diagnosis, treatment, and/or medication information.

This topic will discuss the pathophysiology, risk factors, clinical presentation, diagnosis, complications, and management of this rare condition. The literature about incarcerated gravid uterus consists primarily of single case reports; thus, there is a lack of high-quality evidence to guide management.\nPREVALENCE\nIncarcerated uterus has been reported to occur in 1 in 3000 to 10,000 pregnancies [1].\nPATHOPHYSIOLOGY\nThe uterus is retroverted (and/or retroflexed) in up to 20 percent of pregnancies [2]. As the uterus enlarges during pregnancy, the retroverted/retroflexed fundus normally rises from the hollow of the sacrum to an anterior ventral position, spontaneously correcting any retroposition. In rare cases, however, the fundus becomes wedged below the sacral promontory, where it continues to enlarge normally for a period of time [3]. The cervix becomes displaced cephalad against or above the symphysis pubis and pushes against the urethra and bladder, which can interfere with normal voiding.\nAs the pregnancy progresses beyond 20 weeks of gestation, the posterior pelvis becomes too small to allow further fundal enlargement, so the anterior lower uterine wall begins to thin and balloon into the upper abdomen, developing a sacculation to accommodate the products of conception [4]. This is termed \"inverted polarity\" because the anterior lower uterine wall becomes cephalad to the fundus, which is posterior-caudal. Concomitantly, both the bladder and the cervix are pulled up into the abdominal cavity toward the umbilicus. The cervix can stretch to 10 cm or more in length, such that the internal os becomes located above the symphysis pubis and occasionally above the bladder [5]. Normal and incarcerated anatomy are shown in the figures (figure 1A-B).\nRISK FACTORS\nAny condition that may inhibit the fundus of the enlarging uterus from ascending out of the sacral hollow is a risk factor for incarceration. The most common of these conditions include [4,6-8]:\nTo continue reading this article, you must sign in with your personal, hospital, or group practice subscription.\nSubscribe\nSign in\nDisclaimer: This generalized information is a limited summary of diagnosis, treatment, and/or medication information.

It almost always involves the rectum and may extend in a proximal and continuous fashion to involve other portions of the colon. The pattern of disease activity is characterized by periods of active inflammation alternating with periods of remission.\nMost patients with UC are treated with pharmacologic therapy, and multiple drugs are available. Therapies can be grouped as induction therapies (ie, relatively rapid onset of action) and maintenance therapies (ie, appropriate for long-term use). Some therapies (eg, biologic agents, small molecules) are used for both induction and maintenance of remission. While glucocorticoids may be used for inducing remission, they are not effective or suitable for maintaining remission. As a result, the term \"maintenance of remission\" refers to glucocorticoid-free remission.\nThe focus of this topic is the medical management of adult patients with moderate to severe UC in an ambulatory setting.

The risk of developing CRC is influenced by both environmental and genetic factors.\nThe epidemiology of CRC and risk factors for its development will be discussed here. Other topics related to colorectal cancer are discussed separately.\n\u25cf\nCRC screening \u2013 (See \"Screening for colorectal cancer in patients with a family history of colorectal cancer or advanced polyp\" and \"Tests for screening for colorectal cancer\" and \"Screening for colorectal cancer: Strategies in patients at average risk\".)\n\u25cf\nClinical presentation and diagnosis of CRC \u2013 (See \"Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and staging of colorectal cancer\" and \"Pretreatment local staging evaluation for rectal cancer\".)\n\u25cf\nTreatment of CRC \u2013 (See \"Overview of the management of primary colon cancer\" and \"Overview of the management of rectal adenocarcinoma\".)\nEPIDEMIOLOGY\nCRC incidence and mortality rates vary markedly around the world. Globally, CRC is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in males and the second in females, according to the World Health Organization GLOBOCAN database [1]. Rates of both incidence and mortality are substantially higher in males than in females.\nCRC incidence and mortality have been slowly but steadily decreasing in the United States [2]. Approximately 153,000 new cases of large bowel cancer are diagnosed annually, including about 107,000 cases of colon cancer and over 46,000 cases of rectal cancer [3]. Annually, over 53,000 people die of CRC in the United States.\nIncidence \u2014 The regional incidence of CRC varies globally. The highest incidence rates are in Australia and New Zealand, Europe, and North America, and the lowest rates are found in Africa and South-Central Asia [4]. These geographic differences appear to be attributable to differences in dietary and environmental exposures, low socioeconomic status, and lower rates of CRC screening that are imposed upon a background of varying susceptibility [5-7].\nIn the United States, the lifetime incidence of CRC in patients at average risk is approximately 4 percent [8]. CRC incidence is higher in males than in females and in Black Americans than in White Americans [3,9]. The incidence is also higher in patients with specific inherited conditions that predispose them to the development of CRC. (See 'Risk factors' below.)\nA gradual shift toward right-sided or proximal colon cancers has been observed both in the United States [10,11] and internationally [12,13] with the greatest relative increase in incidence in cecal primaries. This change in the anatomic distribution of CRCs may be, in part, related to improvements in diagnosis and treatment, and increased screening with removal of adenomatous polyps in the distal colon. Colonoscopy is more effective in preventing left-sided than right-sided CRCs, which could also contribute to a shift in distribution of cancers in the colon. It is likely that part of the difference is due to aspects of quality relating to the colonoscopy (poor right-sided preps, incomplete colonoscopy, anatomic configurations compromising visibility) but the biology may also differ between CRCs of the right and left colon. For example, serrated lesions, which are flatter and more difficult to visualize endoscopically, characteristically carry BRAF V600E mutations, give rise to microsatellite unstable CRCs, and are more common in the right colon. Although all of these issues may contribute to a shift toward right- rather than left-sided cancers, there also appears to be a true increase in the incidence of ascending colon and cecal cancers [13,14]. (See \"Molecular genetics of colorectal cancer\" and \"Overview of colon polyps\", section on 'Sessile serrated lesions' and \"Tests for screening for colorectal cancer\", section on 'Colonoscopy'.)\nIn the United States, CRC incidence rates had been declining by approximately 2 percent per year, but this rate of decline has slowed to approximately 1.2 percent per year in the period 2014 to 2018 [2]. Incidence rates in most other western countries have been stable or increased slightly during this period. By contrast, CRC incidence rates have rapidly increased in several areas historically at low risk, including Spain, and a number of countries within Eastern Asia and Eastern Europe [15,16].\nMortality \u2014 Death rates from CRC have declined progressively since the mid-1980s in the United States and in many other western countries [2,3,17]. This improvement in outcome can be attributed, at least in part, to detection and removal of colonic polyps, detection of CRCs at an earlier stage, and more effective primary and adjuvant treatments. However, at least in the United States, the decline in CRC mortality started well before the widespread implementation of CRC screening and before effective adjuvant therapy became widely used [18]. (See \"Adjuvant therapy for resected stage III (node-positive) colon cancer\" and \"Adjuvant therapy for resected rectal adenocarcinoma in patients not receiving neoadjuvant therapy\".)\nHowever, notably, in the United States the declining mortality overall is masking trends in younger adults:\n\u25cf\nIn data derived from the SEER Database of the National Cancer Institute, CRC mortality rates per 100,000 population among individuals under age 50 declined by approximately 2 percent per year from 2000 to 2004, and then increased by 1 percent annually through 2018. The increase was limited to White and Hispanic individuals; by contrast among Black individuals and Asian/Pacific Islander individuals, mortality rates were either stable or declined over this same time period [19].\n\u25cf\nSimilar trends are reported by the American Cancer Society [3,9], and the National Center for Health Statistics (figure 1) [20].\nGlobally, the United States has one of the highest survival rates from CRC. Data collected by the SEER Program of the United States National Cancer Institute suggest that nearly 65 percent of all patients treated for CRC (all stages and sites combined) between 2011 and 2017 survive five years [8].\nIn contrast to these data, mortality rates continue to increase in many countries with more limited resources and health infrastructure, particularly in Central and South America and Eastern Europe, as reflected in data from the international WHO GLOBOCAN database [1].\nIncreasing incidence of colorectal cancer in the United States with age, SEER 2017 to 2021\nFigure 2\nAge \u2014 Age is a major risk factor for sporadic CRC. CRC is uncommon before the age of 40; the incidence begins to increase significantly between the ages of 40 and 50, and age-specific incidence rates increase in each succeeding decade thereafter (figure 2). Age is a factor that impacts screening recommendations for CRC. (See 'Factors that may influence screening recommendations' below.)\nEARLY ONSET COLORECTAL CANCER\nAlthough increasing age is a major risk factor for CRC, there is a global epidemiologic trend towards early onset colorectal cancer (EOCRC), or the diagnosis of CRC in people under the age of 50 years. Efforts to reduce the incidence and mortality of EOCRC include assessing for potential modifiable risk factors, identifying individuals eligible for earlier CRC surveillance, and promoting both clinician and patient awareness of the potential symptoms associated with CRC (eg, persistent rectal bleeding at any age [21]). The impact of some of these factors on CRC screening recommendations are discussed separately. (See 'Factors that may influence screening recommendations' below.)\nIncidence \u2014 The incidence of CRC is increasing in individuals under the age of 50 years while it is decreasing in older individuals in the United States and Western countries [3,9,22-31]. In the United States, the proportion of new CRC cases among adults under the age of 55 years increased from 11 to 20 percent between 1995 and 2019 [9]. In multiple lower-middle income countries, the ratios of early to late onset CRC are strikingly higher than the international average and in West countries, but this may be partly due to the limited life expectancy of those populations [32]. Some studies also report a rising incidence of CRC even among young adults up to 39 years of age, although the absolute number of cases in this age group remains far lower than for adults aged 50 or over [33-35].\nThese findings are being driven predominantly by left-sided cancers and rectal cancer [9,27,36,37]. It is also likely that the increased incidence of EOCRC is real and not representative of a shift in age at diagnosis attributable to earlier detection. For instance, among patients diagnosed with CRC under the age of 50 years, a majority (over 86 percent) are symptomatic, and their disease is being diagnosed at later stages [25,38,39].\nRisk factors \u2014 The reason(s) underlying EOCRC may be multifactorial, with contributions from genetic influences as well as environmental and lifestyle exposures [40]. Possible risk factors for EOCRC include:\n\u25cf\nHereditary CRC syndromes \u2013 In the United States, it is estimated that up to 35 percent of these young adult cancers are associated with the known hereditary CRC syndromes, but the causes for the balance remain unknown [36,37,41-43]. A similar trend has also been observed in lower middle-income countries with lower rates of CRC compared with Western countries [1]. The high proportion of germline variants in these younger individuals emphasizes the importance of referral for genetic counseling and testing [44]. (See 'Hereditary CRC syndromes' below and \"Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer): Clinical manifestations and diagnosis\", section on 'Indications for germline testing'.)\n\u25cf\nMetabolic dysregulation \u2013 Potential risk factors include obesity [45-47], metabolic syndrome [45,48,49], metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease [50], sedentary behavior [45], red meat intake [48], unhealthy dietary patterns [51-53], hypertension [45,48], and hyperlipidemia [45,46,48]. (See 'Obesity' below.)\n\u25cf\nHistory of CRC in a first-degree relative [45-48]\n\u25cf\nAlcohol consumption (particularly in heavy users) [45-47,53,54]\n\u25cf\nLack of regular use of NSAIDs [47,53]\n\u25cf\nVitamin D intake \u2013 Increased vitamin D intake may be a protective factor for EOCRC [48,55], although this requires further study. (See 'Vitamin D' below.)\n\u25cf\nOther factors \u2013 Limited data suggest other potential risk factors such as alterations in the gastrointestinal microbiome [56,57], ulcerative colitis and other inflammatory bowel diseases [45,49], chronic kidney disease [45], occupational exposure to organic dusts [45], level of educational attainment [53], and socioeconomic status [47].\n\u25cf\nIs EOCRC genomically different from average-onset CRC? \u2013 Data are mixed as to whether EOCRC is genomically different from average-onset CRC, and further studies are necessary. In some studies, EOCRC is associated with more advanced age-associated methylomic drift and accelerated aging in the normal mucosa of people with EOCRC; this suggests that drivers to methylation profiles characteristic of CRC are active earlier in EOCRC [58]. However, other studies have failed to find evidence that EOCRC is clinically and genomically distinguishable from average-onset CRC [37].\nRISK FACTORS\nAlthough data support the view that some risk factors are more related to colon than to rectal cancer [59], we will consider both entities together.\nEnvironmental and genetic factors can increase the likelihood of developing CRC [60]. Although inherited susceptibility results in the most striking increases in risk, the majority of CRCs are sporadic rather than familial. These risk factors can be separated into those that confer a sufficiently high risk to alter recommendations for CRC screening, factors that may alter screening recommendations, and those that do not alter screening recommendations because they are thought to confer a small or uncertain magnitude of risk.\nFactors that influence screening recommendations \u2014 CRC screening recommendations are modified for members of families with hereditary colon cancer syndromes, on the basis of personal or family history of CRC or adenomas, in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, and in those who have been exposed to abdominal radiation therapy.\nHereditary CRC syndromes \u2014 Several specific genetic disorders, most of which are inherited in an autosomal-dominant fashion, are associated with a very high risk of developing colon cancer. (See \"Molecular genetics of colorectal cancer\".)\nFamilial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer [HNPCC]) are the most common of the familial colon cancer syndromes, but together these two conditions account for only approximately 5 percent of CRC cases, the majority of which are Lynch syndrome [61-64]. (See \"Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer): Clinical manifestations and diagnosis\" and \"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of familial adenomatous polyposis\".)\nAs many as 12 percent of unselected patients with CRC carry one or more pathogenic mutations in cancer-predisposing genes, and the majority of these are not Lynch syndrome or FAP [64]. In this analysis of 1058 individuals with CRC attending a tertiary American Cancer Center, 105 patients had one or more pathogenic mutations. Seventy-four (7 percent of the total) carried non-Lynch syndrome mutations, which included mutations in high-penetrance genes (APC, biallelic MUTYH, BRCA1 and BRCA2, PALB2, CDKN2A, and TP53), as well as moderate-penetrance genes (monoallelic MUTYH [65], APC allele p.I1307K [66], CHEK2) for which the risk of CRC is not well defined. Broadening the approach, universal genetic testing yielded 6.4 percent more clinically actionable pathogenic germline variants in a series of patients presenting with solid tumors, many of whom had CRC [67]. With the falling costs of genetic testing, the reach of genetic testing is likely to extend further.\nAn even higher proportion (16 percent) of early onset CRCs (ie, diagnosed prior to age 50) may be associated with an inherited syndrome [68]. Furthermore, one-third of those found to have a potentially pathogenic germline mutation did not meet established genetic testing criteria for the gene in which they had a mutation. These data suggest that genetic counseling and testing with a multigene panel could be considered for all patients with early onset CRC.\nAdenomatous polyposis syndromes\nFAP \u2014 Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and its variants (Gardner syndrome, Turcot syndrome, and attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis [AFAP]) account for less than 1 percent of CRCs. In typical FAP, numerous colonic adenomas appear during childhood. Symptoms appear at an average age of approximately 16 years and colonic cancer occurs in 90 percent of untreated individuals by age 45 (picture 1 and picture 2). AFAP carries a high risk of colon cancer (though its magnitude is not as well defined), but AFAP is characterized by fewer adenomas and an older average age of cancer diagnosis of 54 years. Clinical experience suggests less discrimination between FAP and AFAP, as there can be age-matched individuals with thousands of adenomas as well as those with oligo-polyposis within the same family. (See \"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of familial adenomatous polyposis\", section on 'Attenuated FAP'.)\nFAP is caused by germline mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene which is located on chromosome 5. The same gene is involved in the attenuated form of FAP, but the sites of the APC gene mutations are different. (See \"Molecular genetics of colorectal cancer\" and \"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of familial adenomatous polyposis\" and \"Familial adenomatous polyposis: Screening and management of patients and families\".)\nAn APC gene variant occurring in approximately 6 to 8 percent of the Ashkenazi Jewish population has been associated with a 1.5- to 2-fold increased colon cancer risk without an associated polyposis [66,69]. However, in itself, it does not add risk beyond that of a family history in first-degree relatives and is therefore of limited clinical utility.\nMAP \u2014 MUTYH-associated polyposis (MAP) is an autosomal-recessive syndrome due to biallelic germline mutations in the base excision repair gene mutY homolog (MUTYH). The phenotype of MAP is variable, but it can present with a polyposis phenotype; typically with fewer than 500 adenomas. The base excision repair system repairs mutations due to oxidative DNA damage, and the APC gene appears to be particularly susceptible to such damage. Thus, failure of the base excision repair system often leads to somatic mutations in APC and KRAS, especially G:C to T:A transversions, which can lead to a polyposis phenotype. An increasing number of reports suggest that germline mutations in these MUTYH genes may account for a substantial fraction of familial CRCs that occur in the absence of a dominantly inherited familial syndrome, and that a significant number of biallelic carriers present with cancer without associated polyposis, making their phenotype very difficult to identify. (See \"Molecular genetics of colorectal cancer\", section on 'MUTYH defects and familial colorectal cancer' and \"MUTYH-associated polyposis\".)\nOther polyposis genes (POLE and POLD1, MSH3, and NTHL-associated polyposis [NAP]) are also part of next-generation panels with developing experience of their phenotypes. Pathogenic variants in MSH3 and NTHL-associated polyposis are both inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.\nLynch syndrome \u2014 Lynch syndrome or HNPCC is an autosomal-dominant syndrome that is more common than FAP and accounts for approximately 3 percent of all colonic adenocarcinomas. Lynch syndrome can be suspected on the basis of a strong family history of CRC, endometrial, and other cancers. (See \"Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer): Clinical manifestations and diagnosis\", section on 'Colonic manifestations'.)\nThe name Lynch syndrome honors the pioneering work of Dr. Henry Lynch in drawing attention to the syndrome. The term Lynch syndrome is now commonly reserved for families who have been genetically determined to have a disease-causing defect in one of the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes, most commonly hMLH1, hMSH2, hMSH6, or hPMS2. As a general rule, patients with Lynch syndrome have a germline mutation in one allele of an MMR gene, and the second allele is somatically inactivated in the CRCs by mutation, loss of heterozygosity, or, less commonly, epigenetic silencing by promoter hypermethylation. As a result, Lynch syndrome CRCs have impaired DNA MMR, are hypermutable, and are microsatellite unstable. (See \"Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer): Clinical manifestations and diagnosis\", section on 'Colonic manifestations'.)\nThe colorectal tumors that develop in patients with Lynch syndrome are characterized by early age of onset and a predominance of right-sided lesions. The mean age at initial cancer diagnosis is approximately 48 years, with some patients presenting in their 20s. Nearly 70 percent of first lesions arise proximal to the splenic flexure, and approximately 10 percent will have synchronous (simultaneous onset of two or more distinct tumors) or metachronous cancers (non-anastomotic new tumors developing at least six months after the initial diagnosis). The chance of developing metachronous CRC in those who have had a segmental resection is high: in a study of 382 gene carriers, 16 percent at 10 years, rising to 62 percent at 30 years after primary resection [70].\nExtracolonic cancers are very common in Lynch syndrome, particularly endometrial carcinoma, which may occur in up to 60 percent of female mutation carriers in some families. Other sites at increased risk of neoplasm formation include the ovary, stomach, small bowel, hepatobiliary system, brain and renal pelvis or ureter, and possibly breast and prostate.\nPenetrance estimates for colon and endometrial cancer in carriers of MLH1 or MSH2 mutations were initially thought to be >80 percent, and 40 percent, respectively. However, these early estimates were based on selected families referred for gene testing, which produced biased estimates (upwards). Population-based series suggest that penetrance estimates are approximately one-half of what they were initially thought to be, and indicate that at least for carriers of an MLH1 or MSH2 mutation, the risk is highest in individuals aged 30 to 39, and that much of the risk attributed to this syndrome is over by the mid-50s [71]. Penetrance estimates for MSH6 and PMS2 carriers are even more modest, making identification of families with these genetic mutations more difficult to identify from family history interrogation [72]. MSH6 carriers have a predilection for endometrial cancers. A clinically useful interactive database predicting future risk by gene, sex, age, and organ has been developed [73]. (See \"Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer): Clinical manifestations and diagnosis\" and \"Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer): Cancer screening and management\".)\nAre patients with HBOC syndrome at risk? \u2014 The majority of patients with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) syndrome have mutations in either the breast cancer type 1 or 2 susceptibility gene (BRCA1 and BRCA2). HBOCs attributable to pathogenic variants in BRCA are characterized by an autosomal-dominant pattern of inheritance; markedly increased susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancers, with an especially early onset of breast cancer; and an increased incidence of tumors of other organs, such as the fallopian tubes, prostate, male breast, and pancreas. (See \"Cancer risks in BRCA1/2 carriers\".)\nThe biologic relationship between inherited BRCA gene mutations and CRC is unclear. Although some studies derived from a cancer risk clinic and the Breast Cancer Linkage Consortium have reported an approximately twofold increased risk of colon cancer among BRCA1 mutation carriers [74-76], other population-based series have not confirmed such an association [77,78].\nTwo meta-analyses have come to different conclusions:\n\u25cf\nOne meta-analysis of 18 cohort and case-control studies concluded that carriers of BRCA1 have a higher risk for CRC (odds ratio [OR] 1.49, 95% CI 1.14-1.85) [79]. There were no data on the age of onset of the CRCs in this analysis (although two of the included studies did report a higher risk for early onset CRC [76,80]). The study was also criticized for including family members of BRCA carriers with unknown mutation status; when the analysis was restricted to confirmed BRCA1/2 mutation carriers, the risk was no longer statistically significant [81].\n\u25cf\nA second meta-analysis of BRCA mutation carriers (seven cohort, four case-control studies, 14,252 carriers, with 4831 CRCs identified) failed to find an association between BRCA1/2 mutation carriage and a higher risk for CRC (OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.80-1.32) [82]. Adjustment for age did not alter the outcome. Subgroup analysis also showed no significant increased odds of CRC in BRCA1 carriers (OR 1.27, 95% CI 0.91-1.76), or in those with Ashkenazi Jewish heritage (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.63-1.48).\nThere are no formal guidelines as to whether or not mutation BRCA carriers should initiate CRC screening at an earlier age than is typically recommended. Nevertheless, in our view, there are insufficient data on CRC risk to justify modifying screening guidelines for BRCA carriers. (See \"Cancer risks in BRCA1/2 carriers\", section on 'Other solid tumors'.)\nPersonal or family history of sporadic CRCs or adenomatous polyps \u2014 Patients with a personal history of CRC or adenomatous polyps of the colon are at risk for the future development of colon cancer. In patients undergoing resection of a single CRC, metachronous primary cancers develop in 1.5 to 3 percent of patients in the first five years postoperatively. (See \"Post-treatment surveillance for colorectal cancer\".)\nA personal history of large (>1 cm) adenomatous polyps and polyps with villous or tubulovillous histology or with high-grade dysplasia also increases the risk of CRC, particularly if there are multiple polyps [83]. The relative risk (RR) ranges from approximately 3.5 to 6.5 in such patients. On the other hand, as a group, patients with one or two small (<1 cm) tubular adenomas with only low-grade dysplasia do not appear to be at substantially increased risk for subsequent CRC [83]. Recommendations are to manage these latter patients as average-risk individuals.\nFamily history is also an important risk factor even outside of the syndromes with a defined genetic predisposition. Having a single affected first-degree relative (parent, sibling, or child) with CRC increases the risk approximately twofold over that of the general population [84]. Risk is further increased if two first, or one first and one or more first or second-degree relatives on either side of the family have colon cancer, or if a first-degree relative is diagnosed below 50 years of age [85,86].\nPatients who have a family member with an adenomatous colonic polyp may also be at increased risk for adenomas or cancer [84,87-90]. Some United States guidelines recommend earlier screening (age 40 years) for people with a family history of adenomas in relatives <60 years old or two first-degree relatives regardless of age [91-93], while others limit the recommendation to relatives of those with advanced adenomas [94]. A series from Hong Kong identifying an elevated risk for advanced adenomas in relatives of patients themselves with advanced adenomas supports screening in this group of relatives [95]. Guidelines in other countries (eg, Canada and Australia) do not recommend screening of relatives with adenomas, apart from the multiple polyposis syndromes [96,97]. (See \"Screening for colorectal cancer in patients with a family history of colorectal cancer or advanced polyp\", section on 'Family polyp history'.)\nIn countries where screening is recommended for relatives of adenoma patients, we suggest that patients whose only familial risk factor for CRC is a relative with a history of adenomatous polyp that is not clearly documented as an advanced adenoma (\u22651 cm, or high-grade dysplasia or villous elements) be screened as average-risk patients, with screening options presented separately. Individuals who have a first-degree relative with a documented history of advanced adenoma should be screened similarly to those with a family history of CRC. (See \"Screening for colorectal cancer: Strategies in patients at average risk\", section on 'Choosing a screening test' and \"Screening for colorectal cancer in patients with a family history of colorectal cancer or advanced polyp\", section on 'Family polyp history'.)\nInflammatory bowel disease\nUlcerative colitis \u2014 There is a well-documented association between chronic ulcerative colitis and colonic neoplasia, with the extent, duration, and activity of disease being the primary determinants. Pancolitis confers a 5- to 15-fold increase in risk compared with the expected incidence in the general population, while disease that is limited to the left side of the colon is associated with approximately a threefold RR; in comparison, the risk does not appear to be significantly increased with proctitis or proctosigmoiditis alone [98,99]. There is evidence that some treatments for inflammatory colitis may decrease CRC risk and quiescent disease carries less risk than chronically active disease, justifying a reduction in frequency of surveillance [100]. (See \"Medical management of low-risk adult patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis\".)\nA reasonable estimate of the colon cancer incidence is approximately 0.5 percent per year for subjects with disease duration between 10 and 20 years, then 1 percent per year thereafter. Most reports suggest that the co-occurrence of ulcerative colitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis identifies a subset of patients with an even greater risk. Others have identified the presence of pseudopolyps as an independent risk factor, particularly if large and complex. Strictures should always raise a suspicion of malignancy. (See \"Surveillance and management of dysplasia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease\", section on 'Ulcerative colitis' and \"Primary sclerosing cholangitis: Inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer\" and \"Overview of colon polyps\", section on 'Inflammatory pseudopolyps'.)\nThe increase in risk of colon cancer begins approximately 8 to 10 years after the initial diagnosis of pancolitis, and at 15 to 20 years for colitis limited to the left colon (image 1). The probability of developing cancer then increases with disease duration and in those with active inflammation; by the fourth decade of disease it reaches as high as 30 percent in patients with pancolitis. (See \"Surveillance and management of dysplasia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease\", section on 'Extensive colitis'.)\nCrohn disease \u2014 Although there are much less data, it appears that pancolitis due to Crohn disease is associated with a similar RR of colon malignancy as extensive ulcerative colitis, although the data are less consistent. Recommendations from expert groups vary for Crohn disease where there is less colonic involvement, but most guidelines recommend surveillance when one-third or more of the colonic mucosa is involved. (See \"Surveillance and management of dysplasia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease\", section on 'Crohn disease'.)\nAbdominopelvic radiation \u2014 Cancer survivors who received abdominopelvic radiation therapy in childhood or as adults are at significantly increased risk of subsequent gastrointestinal neoplasms, the majority being CRC [101-104].\nFor adult survivors of pediatric cancer, there is no consensus as to the optimal time to start screening and the optimal interval between screening evaluations. Guidelines from the Children's Oncology Group recommend colonoscopy every five years for survivors of childhood cancer who received abdominal, pelvic, spine, or total-body irradiation, with screening beginning five years after radiation therapy or at age 30 years, whichever occurs later [105]. Screening options include colonoscopy every five years (preferred) or multitarget stool DNA test every three years. Others suggest screening every 10 years from age 40 to 60 years as a more cost-effective strategy [106]. Guidelines from expert groups outside of the United States do not specify the time to the start of the screening strategy either [107-109].\nA history of radiation therapy for prostate cancer has been associated with an increased risk of rectal cancer in several database studies [110,111]. The magnitude of risk is approximately similar to that observed in patients with a family history of colonic adenomas. Whether such cancers follow an adenoma to cancer sequence, and whether increased screening in such patients would improve cancer detection rates and outcomes, is unclear. In contrast to adult survivors of childhood cancer, increased surveillance is not recommended in this group.\nCystic fibrosis \u2014 Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) have an elevated risk of CRC. In a meta-analysis, the pooled standardized incidence ratio was 10.91, 95% CI 8.42-14.11, and it was two- to fivefold higher following lung transplantation [112]. The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) has developed guidelines for CRC screening for adults with CF. Although risk estimates are provided, the benefits of screening for CRC in these patients, who as a group have substantial comorbidities, are less certain. This subject is discussed in more detail separately. (See \"Cystic fibrosis: Overview of gastrointestinal disease\", section on 'Gastrointestinal cancer'.)\nFactors that may influence screening recommendations\nAge \u2014 The rising incidence of early onset CRC, particularly among those in the 40 to 49 year old age group, has prompted at least two groups to lower the recommended age of first screening (see 'Early onset colorectal cancer' above):\n\u25cf\nIn 2018, the American Cancer Society issued a \"qualified\" recommendation to begin screening persons at average risk for CRC at age 45 years [113].\n\u25cf\nIn 2021, the United States Preventive Services Task Force changed its recommendation to include screening for CRC in adults starting at age 45 [114].\nOther expert groups have not yet changed their recommendations [115-117]. Screening for CRC is discussed in detail separately. (See \"Screening for colorectal cancer: Strategies in patients at average risk\" and \"Screening for colorectal cancer in patients with a family history of colorectal cancer or advanced polyp\".)\nRace and sex \u2014 Black Americans, Native Americans, and Alaskan Native individuals have among the highest incidence and mortality rates for CRC of all racial and ethnic groups in the United States [9]. In addition, CRCs occur at a younger age, as there is a higher frequency of CRC under age 50 in these populations [118]. Among Black Americans, there also appears to be a more proximal distribution of both CRCs and adenomas. The reasons for these findings are unclear, but may be related to a higher prevalence of risk factors associated with CRC and lower rates of access to screening among these populations.\nScreening strategies do not differ with regard to race. (See \"Screening for colorectal cancer: Strategies in patients at average risk\".)\nCRC mortality is approximately 33 percent higher in males than in females [9]. Both colonic adenomas and CRCs appear to have a more proximal distribution in females [119], particularly in postmenopausal females. None of the major United States organizations recommend that screening be stratified by sex, but some authors have argued that this should be considered [120], or that flexible sigmoidoscopy is an inadequate screening test in females [119].\nAcromegaly \u2014 Most reports suggest that colonic adenomas and CRC both occur with increased frequency in acromegaly [121,122], particularly in those with uncontrolled disease.\nGuidelines from the Acromegaly Consensus Group recommend colonoscopy for early detection and treatment of premalignant colonic polyps at the time of diagnosis [123].\nRenal transplantation \u2014 Renal transplantation, in association with long-term immunosuppression, has been linked with increased CRC risk [124,125]. In general, cancer rates in kidney transplant recipients are similar to those of non-transplanted individuals 20 to 30 years older [125]. However, many renal transplant recipients have comorbidities that need to play into screening decisions for CRC. (See \"Malignancy after solid organ transplantation\".)\nRisk factors that do not alter screening recommendations \u2014 A number of clinical environmental and lifestyle factors are associated with a small and/or uncertain increased risk of CRC. Although many of these associations have been seen consistently in observational studies, the causal relationship of these associations is largely unproven. Patients may be counseled about these associations and encouraged to reduce or avoid such factors for the primary prevention of CRC.\nObesity \u2014 Obesity is a risk factor for CRC [126,127]. A systematic review and meta-analysis of data from 13 studies reported that a weight gain between early adulthood and midlife was associated with a modest but significant increase in the risk of CRC (hazard ratio [HR] 1.23, 95% CI 1.14-1.34) [126]. The HR for weight gain between midlife and older adulthood was lower, but still statistically significant (HR 1.15, 95% CI 1.08-1.24). The risk was highest for those in the highest weight gain category. Obesity also appears to increase the likelihood of dying from CRC. (See \"The roles of diet, physical activity, and body weight in cancer survivors\" and \"Overweight and obesity in adults: Health consequences\", section on 'Cancer' and \"Adjunctive therapy for patients with resected early stage colorectal cancer: Diet, exercise, NSAIDs, and vitamin D\", section on 'Diet and exercise'.)\nThe excess risk associated with obesity is reduced after bariatric surgery, with at least one report suggesting that CRC rates approximate those in the general population within five or six years of surgery [128,129]. (See \"Bariatric surgery for management of obesity: Indications and preoperative preparation\" and \"Outcomes of bariatric surgery\".)\nDiabetes mellitus and insulin resistance \u2014 Diabetes mellitus is associated with an elevated risk of CRC [130-140]. A meta-analysis of 14 studies (6 case-control and 8 cohort) estimated that the risk of colon cancer among diabetics was approximately 38 percent higher than nondiabetics (RR 1.38, 95% CI 1.26-1.51), and for rectal cancer it was 20 percent higher (RR 1.20, 95% CI 1.09-1.31) [137]. The associations remained when the analysis was limited to studies that controlled for smoking, obesity, and physical activity. This level of increased risk is insufficient to influence surveillance recommendations based upon other factors such as age.\nOne possible explanation linking diabetes to CRC is hyperinsulinemia, because insulin is an important growth factor for colonic mucosal cells and stimulates colonic tumor cells [141-143]. Plasma concentrations of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and IGF binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) were reported to influence the risk of CRC in a cohort of 14,916 males who were followed prospectively [144]. Subjects with values of IGF-1 in the highest quintiles were more likely to develop CRC compared with those with values in the lowest quintiles (RR 2.51).\nIn addition to increasing risk of the disease, diabetes may also influence prognosis among patients with CRC [145,146]. As an example, in one cohort study of patients with non-metastatic CRC who were enrolled in the Cancer Prevention Study-II Nutrition Cohort, individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus had a significantly higher risk of cancer-specific mortality relative to those without diabetes [145]. The association was not related to insulin levels as use of insulin did not influence CRC mortality.\nRed and processed meat \u2014 Although the data are not entirely consistent, long-term consumption of red meat or processed meats appears to be associated with an increased risk of CRC, particularly for left-sided tumors [147-151]. High temperature cooking (eg, barbecuing, pan-frying) has been implicated as contributing to risk, perhaps by the production of polyaromatic hydrocarbons and other carcinogens produced from proteins in the charring process. Lean red meat may be associated with less risk [152].\nIn 2015, the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) reviewed the evidence linking intake of red and processed meat with CRC; they classified consumption of processed meat as carcinogenic to humans and consumption of red meat as probably carcinogenic [153]; this position was reiterated in its 2020 report [154]. In 2018, the World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research (WCRF/AICR) similarly concluded that the evidence was convincing that consumption of processed meat increases risk of CRC, whereas the evidence for consumption of unprocessed red meat was classified as probable. It is estimated that for every 50 grams of processed meat consumed per day, the risk of CRC increases by approximately 16 percent, and for every 100 grams of red meat consumed per day, it increases by approximately 12 percent [154]. For colon cancer, these estimates were 23 and 22 percent, respectively.\nBased upon the amount of data and the consistent association of CRC with processed meats across studies in different populations, which make chance, bias, and confounding unlikely as explanations, the IARC concluded that there was sufficient evidence in human beings to classify processed meats (eg, sausages, bacon, ham, beef jerky, corned beef, and other smoked, salted, fermented, or cured meats) as group 1 carcinogens, placing these foods in the same risk category for cancer as asbestos, cigarettes, and alcohol (although the amount of increased risk is nowhere near the same) [153,154].\nChance, bias, and confounding could not be ruled out with the same degree of confidence for the data on red meat consumption, since no clear association was seen in several high-quality studies, and residual confounding from other diet and lifestyle factors was difficult to exclude. Nevertheless, the working group concluded that there is limited evidence in human beings for the carcinogenicity of consuming red meat (ie, beef, pork, lamb, veal, mutton, horse, goat) and classified these foods as group 2A carcinogens (probably associated). Other dietary guidelines also support limiting consumption of red and processed meat [155].\nHowever, these conclusions are based entirely on observational studies. It is important to note that data from at least two randomized trials are not consistent with the hypothesis that red and/or processed meat consumption increases the risk of colorectal neoplasia [156]. As an example, the Women's Health Initiative, which involved almost 50,000 females, was unable to show that a reduction in dietary fat, including animal fat, reduced risk of CRC after more than eight years of follow-up [157]. (See \"Dietary fat\", section on 'Cancer'.)\nFurthermore, at least some data suggest that the association between consumption of processed meat and risk of CRC may be modified by inherited susceptibility [158].\nIn 2019, dietary recommendations proposed by the Nutritional Recommendations Consortium (NutriRECS) indicated that prior recommendations that adults reduce their current red and processed meat consumption to reduce their risk of CRC were not supported by their analysis [159]. Their recommendation was based on four meta-analyses showing low-certainty evidence of the very small adverse health effects of red and processed meat consumption [160-163] and a systematic review evaluating consumer values and preferences [164]. It is unclear where these recommendations should fit in relation to those of other groups that support limiting consumption of red and processed meats [153,155]. While the findings of their meta-analyses were actually similar to others', their use of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system, which classifies all observational data as low-quality evidence, remains a point of contention.\nOverall, although there may be an increased risk of developing CRC associated with intake of processed meats, the absolute risk is small and only occurs with daily consumption, and it is not clear that all individuals have the same risk. In our view, modest consumption of red and/or processed meat (one to two times weekly at most) is an acceptable part of a healthy, balanced diet. (See \"Healthy diet in adults\".)\nTobacco \u2014 Cigarette smoking has been associated with increased incidence and mortality from CRC. A meta-analysis of 106 observational studies estimated that the risk of developing CRC was increased among cigarette smokers compared with those who never smoked (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.11-1.25) [165]. The risk of dying from CRC was also increased among smokers (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.14-1.37). For both incidence and mortality, the association was stronger for cancer of the rectum than the colon.\nCigarette smoking is also a risk factor for essentially all types of colonic polyps. For adenomatous polyps, the risk is particularly high for more advanced adenomas (ie, larger and with severely dysplastic features) [166]. Smoking is also a risk factor for serrated polyps of the colon, including those that are hyperplastic and those that are with dysplasia [167,168]. In addition, smoking may increase the risk of CRC in patients with Lynch syndrome (HNPCC) [169].\nFor these and a host of other reasons, smoking should be avoided, especially by CRC survivors. (See \"Approach to the care of colorectal cancer survivors\", section on 'Alcohol and tobacco use'.)\nAlcohol \u2014 An association between alcohol consumption and an increased risk of CRC has been observed in several studies. A meta-analysis of 27 cohort and 34 case-control studies concluded that, compared with never drinkers, there was a significant increase in risk of CRC for moderate (two to three drinks per day, summary RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.13-1.28) and heavy drinkers (\u22654 drinks per day, RR 1.52, 95% CI 1.27-1.81), but not light drinkers (\u22641 drink per day, RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.95-1.05) [170]. These results are consistent with other pooled analyses [171-173]. However, in contrast to prior studies, a dose-response analysis found a significant 7 percent increase in risk of CRC even in light drinkers (RR for ingestion of 10 g/day of ethanol 1.07 [95% CI 1.04-1.10]). The elevated risk may be related to interference of folate absorption by alcohol and decreased folate intake [174,175]. (See \"Overview of the risks and benefits of alcohol consumption\".)\nExcessive alcohol consumption is an established, potentially modifiable risk factor for several other malignancies in addition to CRC [154,176], and it also complicates treatment and treatment outcomes by contributing to longer hospitalizations, prolonged recovery, higher health care costs, and greater overall and cancer-related mortality. The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) has issued a statement on the association of alcohol consumption with multiple cancers, which outlines proposals for promoting awareness of the association between alcohol abuse and certain types of cancer, supporting policy efforts to reduce the risk of cancer through evidence-based strategies that prevent excessive use of alcohol, and providing education to oncology providers about the influence of excessive alcohol use on cancer risk and treatment complications [177].\nUse of androgen deprivation therapy \u2014 A review of 107,859 males aged 67 and older with prostate cancer who were included in the linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Reporting (SEER)/Medicare database suggests that long-term androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) may also increase the risk of CRC [178]. Males who received treatment with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or orchidectomy had a higher risk of developing CRC, and the risk increased with longer duration of ADT. Compared with no ADT, the HR for CRC associated with a GnRH agonist for 25 months or longer was 1.31 (95% CI 1.12 to 1.53), and for orchidectomy it was 1.37 (95% CI 1.14-1.66). The mechanism(s) underlying this putative association are unclear, but insulin resistance as a consequence of ADT has been suggested as a possible contributor [179]. These risk estimates fall below those qualifying for special attention in most screening guidelines.\nCholecystectomy \u2014 A relationship between cholecystectomy and right-sided colon cancer has been described in some reports. As an example, in a study of 278,460 patients followed for up to 33 years after surgery, patients who had undergone cholecystectomy had a slightly increased risk of right-sided colon cancer (standardized incidence ratio 1.16), but not more distal colon cancers [180]. Several meta-analyses have confirmed this association with proximal colon cancers [181,182], although discordant data have also been reported [183,184]. The mechanism is thought to be related to alterations in bile acid composition in the colon after cholecystectomy [185-187].\nOther risk factors \u2014 Several other risk factors have been studied:\n\u25cf\nCoronary artery disease \u2013 The presence of coronary artery disease has been associated with an increased risk of CRC and advanced adenomas [188]. The mechanisms underlying the association are unclear but may be related to shared risk factors.\n\u25cf\nUreterocolic anastomoses for bladder surgery \u2013 Ureterocolic anastomoses after extensive bladder surgery are associated with an increased risk of neoplasia in close proximity to the ureteric stoma [189]. (See \"Urinary diversion and reconstruction following cystectomy\", section on 'Ileal conduits'.)\n\u25cf\nEndometrial cancer \u2013 A cohort study from the Manitoba Cancer Registry suggests that young females (50 years or younger) with endometrial cancer are at a four- to fivefold higher chance of developing CRC (particularly right-sided tumors) than the general population [190]. Although previous studies of this question have been inconsistent and this study did not address the contribution of Lynch syndrome to their analyses, it does suggest that females with young-onset endometrial cancer should be screened for Lynch syndrome and considered for colonoscopic screening at or around the time of diagnosis of endometrial cancer. (See \"Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer): Cancer screening and management\".)\n\u25cf\nGastrointestinal microbiome \u2013 Several bacterial and viral agents (eg, Streptococcus bovis, Helicobacter pylori, JC virus, human papilloma virus [HPV], Fusobacterium nucleatum, colonization of the gut by pathogenic strains of E. coli with associated production of colibactin, a DNA-damaging metabolite, and decreased diversity of the gut bacterial microbiome) have been proposed as risk factors for CRC [191-202]. Some data suggest a potential role for intestinal microbiota in mediating the association between diet and colorectal neoplasia [203]. (See 'Fiber' below.)\nIn support of the possibility that alterations in the gut microbiome influence risk, at least some data suggest an association between antibiotic use and colorectal neoplasia, although causality remains uncertain [204,205]. One of the ways in which the gut microbiome might influence colorectal neoplasia is through altering the bioavailability of aspirin [206]. (See 'Aspirin and NSAIDs' below.)\nAn association between H. pylori infection and colorectal polyps and CRC has been described but remains controversial [191,207]. The data linking JC virus infection to CRC have been mixed and inconclusive [191]. The association between infection with S. bovis, particularly the S. gallolyticus subtype [208], and colonic neoplasia is well described, but it is thought to be a consequence of, rather than a risk factor for, colonic neoplasia and is discussed separately. (See \"Association between Helicobacter pylori infection and gastrointestinal malignancy\", section on 'Colon cancer' and \"Infections due to Streptococcus bovis/Streptococcus equinus complex (SBSEC; formerly group D streptococci)\" and \"Infections due to Streptococcus bovis/Streptococcus equinus complex (SBSEC; formerly group D streptococci)\", section on 'Association with colonic neoplasia'.)\n\u25cf\nProlonged sitting \u2013 Several (but not all [209]) studies suggest that prolonged sitting, independent of physical inactivity and obesity, increases the risk of CRC, particularly early onset CRC [210-212]. (See 'Early onset colorectal cancer' above.)\nPROTECTIVE FACTORS\nA number of factors have been reported by at least some studies to be associated with a decreased risk of CRC [213]. These include regular physical activity, a variety of dietary factors, the regular use of aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and hormone replacement therapy in postmenopausal females. None of these factors is used to stratify CRC screening recommendations.\nPhysical activity \u2014 Substantial observational data and several systematic reviews have concluded that regular physical activity, either occupational or leisure time, is associated with protection from CRC [214-219]. In a meta-analysis of 21 studies, there was a significant 27 percent reduced risk of proximal colon cancer when comparing the most versus the least active individuals (relative risk [RR] 0.73, 95% CI 0.66-0.81) [215] and a 26 percent reduction for distal colon cancer (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.68-0.80). The mechanism underlying the apparent protective association of physical activity is not known and no intervention trials of physical activity for CRC prevention have been reported. (See \"The benefits and risks of aerobic exercise\", section on 'Cancer prevention and treatment'.)\nDiet \u2014 Many epidemiologic studies have shown an association between the intake of a diet high in fruits and vegetables and protection from CRC [220-222]. The RR of CRC is approximately 0.5 comparing groups with the highest intake to those with the lowest [222]. However, discordant data have also been published. The link between consumption of produce and CRC was challenged in a prospective cohort study that combined subjects from the Nurses' Health Study (88,764 females) and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (47,325 men) [223]. In that analysis, there was no significant association between the consumption of fruits, vegetables, or the combination on the incidence of either colon or rectal cancer, independent of vitamin supplement use or smoking habits.\nA pooled analysis of fourteen cohort studies, including the previous study, concluded that eating more than 800 g fruit and vegetables daily, compared with less than 200 g, decreased risk for distal (RR 0.74) but not for proximal colon cancer [224]. On the other hand, a later meta-analysis of 19 cohort studies concluded that there was a weak protective effect of fruit and vegetable intake for highest versus lowest intake of fruits and vegetables (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.86-0.99) and that the inverse association appeared limited to distal colon cancers [225]. Most of the risk reduction was attributable to increasing intake above a threshold value of 100 g/day, with relatively little benefit associated with higher levels of intake. As a reference, a typical apple weighs >200 g. These data suggest that there might be little benefit to increasing the consumption of fruits and vegetables beyond the levels associated with eating a reasonable balanced diet.\nCompared with non-vegetarians, vegetarian dietary patterns have also been associated with a significantly reduced risk of CRC, with the effect being most pronounced among pesco-vegetarians [226,227].\nFiber \u2014 A number of laboratory, nutritional, and epidemiologic studies have identified a role for dietary fiber in the pathogenesis of CRC [228]. However, the degree to which dietary fiber protects against the development of adenomas or CRC is uncertain since the results of epidemiologic studies, randomized trials, and meta-analyses of prospective observational studies are discordant:\n\u25cf\nA decreased risk of colonic adenomas and CRC with higher intake of fiber was reported in many epidemiologic studies [229-233].\n\u25cf\nOn the other hand, in an analysis from the combined Nurses' Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study, no relationship was noted between total dietary fiber intake and risk of CRC [234]. Similarly, the Women's Health Initiative Trial found no protective effect of a modest low-fat, increased fiber, and increased fruit and vegetable dietary intervention on CRC incidence [157].\n\u25cf\nA pooled analysis of 13 prospective cohort studies (involving 725,628 males and females followed for 6 to 20 years) found that dietary fiber intake was inversely associated with the risk of CRC, but the association was no longer apparent after accounting for other dietary risk factors [235].\n\u25cf\nA meta-analysis funded by the World Cancer Research Fund found that for every 10 g/day increase in dietary fiber consumption, there was a significant reduction in the risk of CRC by 10 percent [236,237]. There was a difference between different food groups. While fiber from grains was associated with protection from CRC, fruit, vegetable and legume-based fiber was not. This conclusion was partially supported by a later case-control study nested within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and nutrition (EPIC) study, which found that high consumption of whole grains was associated with a lower rate of distal colon cancer development, but there was no association with overall CRC risk [238].\n\u25cf\nIn two randomized controlled studies from the United States as well as one from Australia, fiber supplementation had no significant protective effect for the development of total colorectal adenomas [152,239,240].\n\u25cf\nA systematic review of five studies involving a total of 4349 patients concluded that there was no definitive evidence that increased dietary fiber reduces the incidence or recurrence of adenomatous polyps within a two- to four-year period [241].\nWhile multiple potential explanations may account for the differences among studies [232,242], the type of fiber may be one important factor, as was found in the World Cancer Research Fund meta-analysis. In addition to this analysis, the Australian trial described above, which showed a significant reduction in advanced adenomas (only), used unprocessed wheat bran, which may be more effective in delivering the benefits of cereal fiber as compared with more processed forms [152]. Ultimately, the degree of protection from dietary fiber, if any, will likely remain unsettled in the absence of prospective intervention studies.\nOne intriguing study suggests an interaction between intestinal microbiota (particularly Fusobacterium nucleatum) and dietary intake of fiber in mediating the risk of colorectal neoplasia [203]. Bacteria like F. nucleatum appear to play a role in stimulating colorectal carcinogenesis, possibly through suppression of the host's immune response to the tumor [198,243]. (See 'Other risk factors' above.)\nIn this prospective cohort study using data from the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, a total of 1019 incident colon and rectal cancer cases with available F. nucleatum data (using quantitative polymerase chain reaction) were documented over 26 to 32 years of follow-up [203]. Prudent diets rich in whole grains and dietary fiber were associated with a significantly lower risk for F. nucleatum-positive but not F. nucleatum-negative CRCs.\nResistant starch \u2014 Resistant starch refers to those forms of starch which escape digestion in the small bowel and pass to the colon, where they are fermented with the production of short-chain fatty acids. Butyrate, one of these fatty acids, has antineoplastic properties in the colon [244]. While this led to initial enthusiasm as to the potential of resistant starch as a chemopreventive agent, a randomized trial of resistant starch (Novelose, 30 g daily) failed to show a beneficial impact on adenoma or cancer development in individuals with Lynch syndrome. [245,246]. However, in long-term follow-up of this trial, resistant starch did provide a delayed protective effect on all non-colorectal Lynch syndrome cancers, especially those in the upper gastrointestinal tract [247]. Additional trials of other forms of resistant starch that are capable of delivering higher levels of butyrate to the colon are in progress.\nFolic acid and folate \u2014 Folate is the natural form of the vitamin occurring in food, and folic acid is the synthetic form used in food fortification and supplements. Based upon biochemical pathways, the two may not be equivalent and have different in vitro effects.\nData from animal and human studies have demonstrated that folate inhibits pathogenesis of cancer in a number of tissues including the colon [248]. However, whether folate and folic acid have a role in prevention of CRC is unclear. By contrast, the possibility that folic acid supplementation increases the risk of colon cancer has also been raised. The following represents the available data on folate and CRC risk:\n\u25cf\nA combined analysis of data from two cohorts from the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study provide observational evidence in support of a protective effect from folic acid supplementation [249]. There was an association between total folate intake 12 to 16 years before diagnosis and a lower risk of CRC (RR 0.69; 95% CI 0.51-0.94 for \u2265800 compared with <250 micrograms of folate per day), but no association with more recent intake. By contrast, both long- and short-term intake of total folate was associated with a lower risk of colorectal adenomas, with a strong association with intake four to eight years before diagnosis (OR 0.68; 95% CI 0.60-0.78 for \u2265800 compared with <250 micrograms of folate per day). These observational data suggest that folic acid supplementation could be beneficial in the pre-adenoma stage but not beyond.\n\u25cf\nIn contrast to these data, at least two controlled trials involving patients with colonic adenomas found that folic acid supplementation did not reduce the risk of recurrent adenomas [250,251]. Furthermore, in one of the trials, supplementation was associated with an increased risk of having three or more adenomas and of non-CRCs, raising the possibility that folic acid supplementation in adults could be detrimental rather than beneficial for adenoma formation, particularly in those who already have a propensity to form colonic neoplasms [250,252]. An increased risk of colorectal neoplasia from folic acid supplementation or in patients with high plasma levels of unmetabolized folic acid (which accumulates if the body's capacity to reduce folic acid is exceeded) has not been confirmed by others [225,253,254].\nVitamin B6 (pyridoxine) \u2014 The available data suggest a modest association between higher vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) intake and decreased CRC risk. In a meta-analysis of prospective studies, the pooled RRs of CRC for the highest versus lowest categories of vitamin B6 intake and of blood levels of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (the active form of vitamin B6) were 0.90 (95% CI 0.75-1.07) and 0.52 (95% CI 0.38-0.71), respectively [255]. Omitting one study that contributed substantially to heterogeneity in the studies of vitamin B6 intake, the protective effect of highest versus lowest vitamin B6 intake on CRC risk was statistically significant (pooled RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.69-0.92).\nCalcium and dairy products \u2014 Another possible protective factor is increased intake of dietary or supplemental calcium [256-263].\nAt least three controlled trials have evaluated the efficacy of calcium supplementation in prevention of recurrence of colorectal adenomas. A meta-analysis of these data (including a total of 1485 subjects) concluded that the risk of recurrence was significantly lower in patients randomized to calcium (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.68-0.93) [264].\nDespite these benefits in adenoma prevention trials, whether calcium supplementation reduces the risk of CRC is unproven. The following data are available:\n\u25cf\nA protective effect of higher calcium intake on the risk of CRC was suggested in an analysis of combined data from the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study [265]. Calcium intake was assessed every four years. Total calcium intake (\u22651400 versus <600 mg/day) was associated with a statistically significant lower risk of colon cancer (multivariable RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.65-0.95).\n\u25cf\nOn the other hand, a controlled trial of 36,282 postmenopausal females who were randomly assigned to the combination of calcium (1000 mg daily) plus vitamin D3 (400 units daily) or placebo showed no significant difference in the rate of invasive CRC during a mean follow-up of seven years [266]. Questions have been raised as to whether the doses of calcium and vitamin D3 that were used in the trial were sufficient to prevent colon cancer.\nHowever, a subsequent trial of 2303 older females who were assigned to placebo or higher doses of calcium (1500 mg daily) and vitamin D3 (2000 international units daily) also failed to confirm a lower risk of invasive or in situ CRC in the supplemented group over four years [267].\n\u25cf\nFinally, a post hoc analysis of a randomized controlled trial of calcium and vitamin D reported an increased risk of serrated polyps in those randomized to calcium (adjusted RR 2.65, 95% CI 1.43-4.91) and calcium plus vitamin D (RR 3.81, 95% CI 1.25-11.64) [268].\nThe protective effect of calcium on conventional adenomas may depend upon an individual's genotype for the vitamin D receptor [261] and/or on having normal levels of vitamin D [269].\nCalcium supplementation has been recommended for the primary or secondary prevention of colonic adenomas by the American College of Gastroenterology [259]. (See \"Overview of colon polyps\".)\nEpidemiologic studies of dairy products and CRC risk have provided mixed results, with some studies reporting inverse associations between intake of total dairy products, milk, and/or yogurt and CRC risk, and others finding no association. Dairy products have been hypothesized to protect against CRC because of their high calcium content; however, some dairy products, such as cheese and cream, have a high fat content, which may counterbalance the protective effect, possibly by affecting the bile acid composition in the colon. (See 'Cholecystectomy' above.)\nA meta-analysis of 19 cohort studies concluded that diets with higher milk and total dairy product intake were associated with a significant, but modest, reduction in CRC risk (summary RR for milk 0.82, 95% CI 0.74-0.93) [270]. The protective effect was restricted to colon and not rectal cancer. There was no association between intake of cheese or other dairy products (including low-fat dairy products) and CRC risk.\nVitamin D \u2014 Vitamin D and its metabolites act as inhibitors of CRC progression in model systems by effects that influence both initiation and progression [271]. An analysis by the World Health Organization identified colon cancer as the type of cancer with the greatest risk associated with poor vitamin D status [272].\nObservational studies also suggest an association between low vitamin D levels and the risk of many cancers, including CRC [273,274]. This association was demonstrated in a pooled analysis of 5706 patients with CRC and 7107 control patients with a range of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels [274]. Compared with 25(OH)D levels of 20 to <25 ng/mL, lower levels of 25(OH)D (<12 ng/mL) were associated with a higher risk of CRC (RR 1.31, 95% CI 1.05-1.62). In contrast, higher levels of 25(OH)D (\u226530 ng/mL) were associated with a lower risk of CRC (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.67-0.99 for levels of 30 to <35 ng/mL; RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.59-0.91 for levels of 35 to <40 ng/mL, respectively). These vitamin D levels (30 to 40 ng/mL [75 to 100 nmol/L]) are within the accepted range for optimizing skeletal health. (See \"Vitamin D deficiency in adults: Definition, clinical manifestations, and treatment\", section on 'Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D'.)\nThere are two caveats:\n\u25cf\nIt is not clear if these observed associations are causal as the current interventional data on the protective effect of vitamin D supplementation on the development of colorectal neoplasia are conflicting.\n\u25cf\nWhether the elevated CRC risk seen with vitamin D deficient states can be overcome through supplementation is not known. At least one randomized placebo-controlled trial has concluded that vitamin D supplementation for five years did not result in a lower incidence of any invasive cancer, including CRC [275].\nThis subject is addressed in detail separately. (See \"Vitamin D and extraskeletal health\", section on 'Cancer'.)\nIn addition to these data, there are also some data suggesting an association between poor vitamin D status and mortality in patients with CRC, both in the setting of advanced metastatic disease and resected potentially curable disease. (See \"Adjunctive therapy for patients with resected early stage colorectal cancer: Diet, exercise, NSAIDs, and vitamin D\", section on 'Vitamin D status' and \"Initial systemic therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer\", section on 'What is the role of vitamin D?'.)\nMagnesium \u2014 Animal studies suggest that dietary magnesium may influence CRC development. A population-based study from Sweden found an inverse association between magnesium intake and the risk of CRC in females [276]. Compared with females in the lowest quintile of magnesium intake, the risk was reduced by approximately 40 percent (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.40-0.87) in females with the highest quintile of intake. The inverse association was observed for both colon and rectal cancer.\nGarlic \u2014 Consumption of garlic has been associated with a reduced risk of colonic adenomas in some observational studies of patients with CRC and in laboratory studies [277,278]. Garlic has been included as a probable protective factor by the World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute of Cancer Research [237] but a review by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) concluded that there was \"very limited credible evidence for a relation between garlic consumption and reduced colon cancer risk.\" Additional prospective intervention studies are needed to settle this issue.\nFish consumption \u2014 Consumption of omega 3 fatty acids (mainly as fish oil) has been associated with a reduced incidence of colorectal neoplasia in some observational studies, but the data are conflicting:\n\u25cf\nA meta-analysis of 22 prospective cohort and 19 case-control studies found an overall lower incidence of CRC among individuals with the highest compared with the lowest fish consumption (summary odds ratio [OR] 0.88, 95% CI 0.80-0.95 ) [279].\n\u25cf\nTwo grams daily of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) as its free fatty acid has been shown in a randomized controlled trial to reduce the numbers of adenomas by a net change of 22.4 percent compared with placebo, as well as to improve the global polyp burden, in familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) [280].\n\u25cf\nOn the other hand, in an analysis of data from the placebo-controlled, randomized VITAL (Vitamin D and Omega 3) trial, supplementation with marine omega 3 fatty acids (1 g/day) did not significantly reduce the risk of CRC precursors in the general population [281].\nCoffee intake \u2014 Observational studies have found conflicting evidence on the relationship between coffee consumption and risk of CRC. A link between high rates of coffee consumption and a reduced risk of CRC was reported in a meta-analysis of 12 case-control studies [282] and in three other analyses, one from the National Institutes of Health (NIH)-AARP Diet and Health Study [283], another from the population-based Molecular Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer (MECC) study [284], and a third from Japan [285]. However, data from the Nurses' Health Study, the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, a meta-analysis of 12 prospective cohort studies, and a pooled analysis of data from 13 prospective cohort studies do not support this finding [286-288].\nDrugs \u2014 Several drugs have been shown to have modest to moderate chemopreventive effects in average- and high-risk populations.\nAspirin and NSAIDs \u2014 Aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may protect against the development of colonic adenomas and is associated with a decreased long-term risk of colorectal cancer. Further details are discussed separately. (See \"NSAIDs (including aspirin): Role in prevention of colorectal cancer\" and \"Aspirin in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer\", section on 'Colorectal cancer'.)\nSulindac plus DFMO or erlotinib \u2014 Chemoprevention with the combination of difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) and sulindac (a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug) has been evaluated in one randomized controlled trial [289]. DFMO is an enzyme-activated irreversible inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase, the first, and rate-limiting, enzyme in polyamine synthesis. It was initially developed as a chemotherapy agent because of its cytostatic effects on a variety of cell lines.\nIn the trial, 375 patients with a history of a resected colonic adenoma were randomly assigned to the combination of sulindac plus DFMO or placebo for three years. The trial was halted after an interim analysis found marked significant reductions in the rate of recurrent adenomas (12 versus 41 percent, RR 0.30), advanced adenomas (0.7 versus 8.5 percent, RR 0.09), and multiple adenomas (0.7 versus 13.2 percent, RR 0.06). Active therapy was associated with a higher rate of mild, subclinical adverse changes in the audiogram (18.4 versus 9.8 percent), which improved in some patients after drug discontinuation. Trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of this regimen have been started in FAP and in patients after treatment for early stage CRC.\nErlotinib, an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor, has also been evaluated in combination with sulindac in patients with FAP. In a randomized placebo-controlled trial, the use of sulindac plus erlotinib for six months resulted in a significantly lower duodenal polyp burden after six months as compared with placebo [290]. However, the utility of this combination is limited by side effects and cost, especially in populations that are not high risk [291]. (See \"Familial adenomatous polyposis: Screening and management of patients and families\", section on 'Chemoprevention'.)\nHormone therapy in females \u2014 Postmenopausal hormone therapy (both combined estrogen plus progestin and unopposed estrogen) has been linked to a reduced risk of CRC [292-300], although the data are more consistent for use of combined (plus progesterone) rather than for unopposed estrogen [292,301]. As an example, a reduction in CRC risk was noted in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) in females taking combined estrogen plus progestin hormone therapy (HR 0.56) [302]. This protective effect remained even after females who reported having screening sigmoidoscopy were excluded. No significant difference in the risk of CRC compared with placebo (HR 1.08) was noted in the unopposed conjugated equine estrogen arm in the WHI [292]. An important finding was that although females receiving combined estrogen and progestin had a lower diagnosis rate of CRC than did the control group, the tumors that did occur in this group were found at a more advanced stage than those found in the control group.\nLonger-term follow-up of the WHI data confirmed that the CRCs diagnosed in females receiving combined hormonal therapy were more advanced at diagnosis (regional or distant metastases in 69 versus 51 percent), and were associated with a nonstatistically significant higher mortality rate (37 versus 27 deaths, 0.04 versus 0.03 percent, HR for death 1.29, 95% CI 0.78-2.11) [303]. These data suggest the puzzling possibility that HRT may decrease CRC incidence but not mortality. Such a paradox could be explained by a systematic diagnostic delay in females receiving combined estrogen and progestin postmenopausal hormone therapy or could suggest that HRT actually affects the biology of CRC.\nEven prior to the data cited above [303], postmenopausal hormone therapy was not recommended for chemoprevention of colon cancer in females because of the associated long-term risks of therapy. (See \"Menopausal hormone therapy: Benefits and risks\", section on 'Colorectal cancer'.)\nIn addition to these data, a protective effect of oral contraceptives in premenopausal females was shown in the Royal College of General Practitioners' Oral Contraception Study [304]. In this study, 46,022 females were recruited in 1968 and 1969 and were observed for up to 44 years. Compared with females who never took them, \"ever use\" of oral contraceptives was associated with a significantly reduced incidence of CRC (incidence rate ratio 0.81, 95% CI 0.66-0.99).\nStatins \u2014 Some observational data suggest that statins are associated with a protective effect against several cancers, including colon cancer, but overall, the data are conflicting.\nThe data regarding CRC are as follows:\n\u25cf\nA modest reduction in the incidence of colon cancer, as a secondary endpoint, was observed in two clinical trials evaluating the benefit of pravastatin and simvastatin for coronary artery disease [305,306].\n\u25cf\nA reduced risk of CRC was also observed in the MECC study, a population-based case-control study in which data regarding personal and family history of cancer, medical conditions, medication use, physical activity, and nutrition were collected from 1953 patients diagnosed with CRC and 2015 population-based controls matched for age, sex, and ethnicity [307]. In this study, use of statins for at least five years was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of CRC (odds ratio [OR] 0.53, 95% CI 0.38-0.74) after adjustment for use of aspirin and other NSAIDs, physical activity, hypercholesterolemia, vegetable consumption, and family history. A potential confounding factor is that the cancer population and the controls were drawn from two different databases.\n\u25cf\nOther case-control studies have failed to document a protective benefit of statin use against colon cancer [308-311].\nThe explanation for these conflicting results is unclear.\nAntioxidants \u2014 Several interventional trials have evaluated the efficacy of antioxidants in the prevention of colorectal adenomas. A meta-analysis of eight controlled trials found no convincing evidence that antioxidant supplements had a significant beneficial effect on primary or secondary prevention of colorectal adenomas [312].\nBisphosphonates \u2014 Oral bisphosphonates are commonly used for the treatment of osteoporosis. (See \"Bisphosphonate therapy for the treatment of osteoporosis\".)\nThe possibility that long-term bisphosphonate use was associated with a reduced risk of CRC was initially suggested in two case-control studies and one cohort study [313-315], but not confirmed in a third case-control study [316] or a prospective cohort study [317].\nA meta-analysis of three of these case-control studies with a total of 16,998 CRC cases and 108,197 controls, and one cohort study with 94,405 individuals exposed to bisphosphonates and 283,181 unexposed to bisphosphonates [313-316] suggested a marginally reduced risk of CRC with any exposure to oral bisphosphonates (odds ratio [OR] 0.71, 95% CI 0.78-0.97) [318]. The inverse relationship was statistically significant at a dose of 10 or more prescriptions, or one or more years of oral bisphosphonate use. However, there were two potential problems with this analysis:\n\u25cf\nConfounding factors may weaken the conclusions of this study. Obesity (body mass index [BMI] >30 kg/m2) is a risk factor for CRC, and patients with obesity included in the meta-analysis might have been exposed to bisphosphonates less frequently than were patients without obesity. The risk for CRC was adjusted for BMI in only two of the four included studies [319]. (See 'Obesity' above.)\n\u25cf\nFor unclear reasons, the analysis did not include a second null study of a cohort of 86,277 females enrolled onto the Nurses' Health Study, 801 of whom developed CRC [317]. The age-adjusted HR for CRC among females who regularly used bisphosphonates was 0.92 (95% CI 0.73-1.14) and was further attenuated after adjustment for other risk factors (HR 1.04, 95% CI 0.82-1.33). Risk was not influenced by duration of therapy.\nOn the other hand, a later meta-analysis that did include the Nurses' Health Study data also concluded that the use of bisphosphonate was associated with a modestly reduced risk of CRC (pooled RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.81-0.98) [320].\nAngiotensin II inhibition \u2014 In vitro and in vivo data suggest that angiotensin II is involved in promoting cancer development and that there is a relationship between angiotensin II inhibition and reduced colon cancer cell growth. However, several observational studies and secondary analyses of data from clinical trials examining the relationship between antihypertensive therapy with an angiotensin II-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) and CRC risk have yielded conflicting results [321-324]:\n\u25cf\nA cohort study reported that long-term use of lisinopril was associated with a 41 percent reduction in the risk of advanced colorectal adenoma [321].\n\u25cf\nAnother case-control study assessing ACE-I exposure among 665 patients with CRC failed to demonstrate a significant association; however, the sample size was small and the duration of exposure was short [322].\n\u25cf\nA secondary analysis of data from randomized trials also did not find an association between use of an ACE-I or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) and CRC risk, although the follow-up durations in the included trials were relatively short [323].\n\u25cf\nBy contrast, a nested case-control study among a cohort of patients with hypertension in the EPIC General Practice Research Database provides modest evidence of a potential protective effect of angiotensin II inhibition on CRC risk [324]. Overall, 2847 case patients (diagnosed with CRC after the diagnosis of hypertension) were matched (for age, sex, calendar year, and duration of follow-up) with 28,239 controls, and the average duration of follow-up in both groups was 4.4 years. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) for CRC was 0.84 (95% CI 0.72-0.98) for three or more years of ACE-I/ARB therapy and 0.75 (95% CI 0.58-0.97) for five or more years of exposure. The strength of the association increased with higher dose therapy (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.35-0.79 for three or more years of high-dose exposure). CRC rates were significantly lower among patients exposed to ACE-I/ARB therapy alone when compared with those exposed to other antihypertensive agents exclusive of angiotensin inhibition.\nTaken together, these observational data suggest a potential protective effect of angiotensin II inhibition on CRC risk that is more evident in those receiving long-term and high daily dose therapies, but no intervention trials have thus far shown such an effect.\nINFORMATION FOR PATIENTS\nUpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, \"The Basics\" and \"Beyond the Basics.\" The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5th to 6th grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10th to 12th grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.\nHere are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on \"patient info\" and the keyword(s) of interest.)\n\u25cf\nBeyond the Basics topics (see \"Patient education: Screening for colorectal cancer (Beyond the Basics)\")\nSUMMARY\n\u25cf\nRisk factors and influence on screening recommendations\n\u2022\nThe major factors that increase the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) and influence screening recommendations are certain hereditary forms of CRC, age, a personal or family history of sporadic CRC (and possibly large or advanced adenomas), inflammatory bowel disease, and a history of abdominal irradiation. (See 'Factors that influence screening recommendations' above.)\n\u2022\nSeveral potentially modifiable factors, including obesity, diabetes, tobacco use, excess consumption of alcohol, excess consumption of processed meat, and lack of physical activity, have been consistently identified as risk factors in observational studies, but at present, they do not alter screening recommendations. Patients may be counseled about these associations and encouraged to reduce or avoid such factors for the primary prevention of CRC. (See 'Risk factors that do not alter screening recommendations' above.)\n\u2022\nOther risk factors have been identified, including race, sex, acromegaly, and a history of renal transplantation, but their influence on screening recommendations has been variable. (See 'Factors that may influence screening recommendations' above.)\n\u2022\nThere is a global epidemiologic trend towards early onset colorectal cancer (EOCRC), or the diagnosis of CRC in people under the age of 50 years. Efforts to reduce the incidence and mortality of EOCRC include assessing for potential modifiable risk factors, identifying individuals eligible for earlier CRC surveillance, and promoting both clinician and patient awareness of the potential symptoms associated with CRC (eg, persistent rectal bleeding at any age). (See 'Early onset colorectal cancer' above.)\n\u25cf\nProtective factors\n\u2022\nA substantial body of evidence supports a protective effect of aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) on the development of colonic adenomas and cancer. The potential role of aspirin and other NSAIDs in CRC prevention is discussed separately. (See \"Aspirin in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer\" and \"NSAIDs (including aspirin): Role in prevention of colorectal cancer\".)\n\u2022\nOther protective factors have also been identified, mainly in observational studies, but the strength of some of these associations is uncertain. (See 'Protective factors' above.)\n\u2022\nSpecific types of diets may reduce the risk of CRC. Despite the uncertainty, a protective diet can be defined for clinical purposes to include avoidance of processed and charred red meat, inclusion of vegetables (especially cruciferous) and unprocessed forms of wheat bran (controversial), an adequate amount of folate intake from food, limited caloric intake, and avoidance of excessive alcohol.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe UpToDate editorial staff acknowledges Dennis J Ahnen, MD, now deceased, who contributed to earlier versions of this topic.\nThe UpToDate editorial staff also acknowledges Thomas Weber, MD, now deceased, who contributed to earlier versions of this topic.\nREFERENCES\nGlobal Cancer Observatory.

Invasion of the central nervous system (meningitis or meningoencephalitis) and bacteremia are the principal clinical manifestations of listerial infection in these hosts. In contrast, normal hosts who ingest high numbers of Listeria may develop self-limited febrile gastroenteritis.\nThe epidemiology, microbiology, and pathogenesis of listerial infection will be reviewed here. The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and prevention of listerial infections are discussed separately. (See \"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Listeria monocytogenes infection\" and \"Treatment and prevention of Listeria monocytogenes infection\".)\nMICROBIOLOGY\nL. monocytogenes is the only Listeria species that regularly infects humans, although rare cases of human infections with Listeria ivanovii (a pathogen of ruminants) and Listeria grayi have been reported [1,2]. Listeria is an aerobic and facultatively anaerobic, motile, beta-hemolytic, non\u2013spore-forming, short, gram-positive rod that exhibits characteristic tumbling motility by light microscopy (movie 1 and picture 1) [3,4]. Listeria occurs singly or in short chains. On Gram stain, Listeria may resemble pneumococci (diplococci), enterococci, or diphtheroids (Corynebacteria) or be gram variable and be confused with Haemophilus species (picture 2) [3-5]. In particular, when a positive blood or cerebrospinal fluid culture is preliminarily identified as diphtheroids, the clinician should consider the possibility that the isolate represents Listeria [3].\nListeria produces a characteristic appearance on blood agar with small zones of clear beta-hemolysis around each colony (picture 3). Listeria grows well at refrigeration temperatures (4\u00b0 to 10\u00b0C). Rarely, the \"cold enrichment\" technique and selective media are used when attempting to isolate Listeria from mixed cultures, such as stool [4].\nPATHOGENESIS\nListeria is a facultative intracellular parasite [6]. The primary habitat of Listeria is the soil and decaying vegetable matter. Most Listeria infections in adults are thought to result from oral ingestion and subsequent intestinal mucosal penetration and systemic infection (movie 2).\nTo continue reading this article, you must sign in with your personal, hospital, or group practice subscription.\nSubscribe\nSign in\nDisclaimer: This generalized information is a limited summary of diagnosis, treatment, and/or medication information.

Conventional echoendoscopes operate across ultrasound frequencies ranging from 6 to 12 MHz, resulting in a spectrum of penetration depth and image resolution. Higher frequencies provide higher resolution but less penetration, while lower frequencies provide higher penetration but lower resolution.\nAdvances in technology have led to the development of small caliber ultrasound probes (commonly referred to as miniprobes or EUS miniprobes). Because miniprobes have a small outer diameter, they can be introduced through the accessory channel of a standard endoscope and can produce EUS imaging at anatomic locations (eg, ascending colon, cecum) that are not reachable with an echoendoscope. In addition, miniprobes scan at higher frequencies (12 to 20 MHz) than echoendoscopes, and this results in high resolution imaging with a penetration depth of approximately 20 mm.\nThis topic will review imaging principles, procedure technique, and clinical applications of EUS imaging with a miniprobe.\nThe indications, contraindications, and technical aspects related to performing conventional EUS (ie, echoendoscope-guided examination) are discussed separately.

Determining the etiology of pneumothorax dictates immediate and definitive management. Thus, the clinician needs to be familiar with the wide array of etiologies when faced with pneumothorax so that appropriate therapy can be administered promptly to prevent deterioration and recurrence (table 1).\nIn this topic review, the epidemiology and etiology of pneumothorax are discussed. Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of pneumothorax are reviewed in detail elsewhere. (See \"Clinical presentation and diagnosis of pneumothorax\" and \"Treatment of secondary spontaneous pneumothorax in adults\" and \"Treatment of primary spontaneous pneumothorax in adults\" and \"Pneumothorax: Definitive management and prevention of recurrence\".)\nPRIMARY SPONTANEOUS PNEUMOTHORAX\nDefinition \u2014 A primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) is traditionally defined as a pneumothorax which presents without a precipitating external event in the absence of clinical lung disease. Although PSP is not associated with known clinical lung disease (eg, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD]), most affected patients have unrecognized lung abnormalities (mostly subpleural blebs) that likely predispose to pneumothorax [1-5]. However, following investigation, some patients with apparent PSP may have other more serious underlying lung diseases (eg, Birt-Hogg-Dub\u00e9 syndrome, thoracic endometriosis, lymphangioleiomyomatosis), thereby recategorizing them as having secondary spontaneous pneumothorax (SSP). Thus, many experts believe that the distinction between pneumothorax in patients \"without\" lung disease (ie, pneumothorax with subpleural blebs, also known as PSP) and pneumothorax in patients with lung diseases (ie, SSP) is somewhat artificial, and that PSP and SSP may exist on either end of a continuum [6].\nEpidemiology \u2014 PSP is more common in males than females (roughly three to six times higher). The incidence of PSP in males ranges from 7.4 per 100,000 population per year in the United States to 37 per 100,000 population per year in the United Kingdom. The incidence in females ranges from 1.2 per 100,000 population per year in the United States to 15.4 per 100,000 population per year in the United Kingdom [7]. The reason for these geographic differences is unknown. Another hospital database study of emergency department visits from January 2008 to December 2014 reported that 79 percent of pneumothoraces were in males and 21 percent in females [8].\nThe prevalence of asymptomatic PSP is unknown, but one retrospective study of Japanese students suggested that the rate may be as high as 0.042 percent and higher in males than females [9]. Mild collapse (ie, <10 percent collapse) was present in approximately half of individuals, most of whom underwent intervention.\nTo continue reading this article, you must sign in with your personal, hospital, or group practice subscription.\nSubscribe\nSign in\nDisclaimer: This generalized information is a limited summary of diagnosis, treatment, and/or medication information.

Diarrhea caused by chemotherapy, referred to here as chemotherapy-related diarrhea (CRD), is a serious and potentially life-threatening complication of a wide variety of chemotherapy drugs and hospital admission is frequently needed for adequate supportive care. CRD may also result in treatment delays and diminished compliance, which may compromise long-term outcomes.\nThis topic will review the management of CRD. The pathogenesis of CRD, predictive markers for fluoropyrimidine- and irinotecan-related diarrhea, and management of diarrhea in patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors are discussed in detail separately. (See \"Clinical presentation and risk factors for chemotherapy-associated diarrhea, constipation, and intestinal perforation\", section on 'Diarrhea' and \"Immune checkpoint inhibitor colitis\".)\nAGENTS MOST COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH DIARRHEA\n\u25cf\nConventional cytotoxic agents \u2013 CRD is a common problem in cancer patients receiving systemic antineoplastic therapy, and is most often described with fluoropyrimidines (particularly fluorouracil [FU] and capecitabine) and irinotecan. Diarrhea is often the dose-limiting and major toxicity of regimens containing a fluoropyrimidine with irinotecan. The frequency of severe (grade 3 or 4 (table 1)) diarrhea with these agents ranges from 5 to 44 percent, and rates vary according to the dose, the specific agents administered, and the schedule of administration. (See \"Clinical presentation and risk factors for chemotherapy-associated diarrhea, constipation, and intestinal perforation\", section on 'Fluorouracil' and \"Clinical presentation and risk factors for chemotherapy-associated diarrhea, constipation, and intestinal perforation\", section on 'Irinotecan'.)\n\u25cf\nMolecularly targeted agents \u2013 In addition to conventional cytotoxic drugs, such as fluoropyrimidines and irinotecan, several molecularly targeted agents are also associated with high rates of CRD:\n\u2022\nFor many tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as afatinib, ceritinib, cabozantinib, lenvatinib, osimertinib, and tucatinib, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors (eg, alpelisib), diarrhea is second only to rash as the most common toxicity. Diarrhea develops in one-half or more of treated patients, although the incidence of severe (grade 3 or 4) diarrhea is lower than with conventional cytotoxic agents. Diarrhea is especially common with ceritinib, neratinib, and afatinib, occurring in 75 to 95 percent of treated patients, but severe in only 2 to 16 percent. (See \"Clinical presentation and risk factors for chemotherapy-associated diarrhea, constipation, and intestinal perforation\", section on 'Small molecule EGFR inhibitors' and \"Clinical presentation and risk factors for chemotherapy-associated diarrhea, constipation, and intestinal perforation\", section on 'Small molecule inhibitors of VEGFR' and \"Clinical presentation and risk factors for chemotherapy-associated diarrhea, constipation, and intestinal perforation\", section on 'Lapatinib, pertuzumab, neratinib, and tucatinib' and \"Clinical presentation and risk factors for chemotherapy-associated diarrhea, constipation, and intestinal perforation\", section on 'ALK inhibitors'.)\nTo continue reading this article, you must sign in with your personal, hospital, or group practice subscription.\nSubscribe\nSign in\nDisclaimer: This generalized information is a limited summary of diagnosis, treatment, and/or medication information.

Nevertheless, the diagnosis and appropriate management of gastric polyps are important, as some polyps have malignant potential.\nThis topic will review the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, histopathology, and management of gastric polyps. Our recommendations are largely consistent with the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy guidelines [1,2]. The clinical manifestations, diagnosis and management of gastric gastrointestinal stromal tumors, leiomyomas, lipomas, and other subepithelial lesions that may have a polypoid appearance on upper endoscopy are discussed in detail, separately. (See \"Endoscopic ultrasound for the characterization of subepithelial lesions of the upper gastrointestinal tract\" and \"Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and prognosis of gastrointestinal stromal tumors\" and \"Local treatment for gastrointestinal stromal tumors, leiomyomas, and leiomyosarcomas of the gastrointestinal tract\".)\nEPIDEMIOLOGY\nGastric polyps are found in approximately 6 percent of upper gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures in the United States [3]. However, lower rates have been reported in other countries [4,5]. Hyperplastic polyps and adenomas are relatively more prevalent as compared with fundic gland polyps in regions where Helicobacter pylori infection is common [4-6]. In contrast, in Western countries, where the prevalence of H. pylori infection is lower and proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use is common, the most commonly encountered polyps are fundic gland polyps (picture 1A-B) [3,6].\nINITIAL EVALUATION\nThe initial approach to gastric polyps should include an evaluation of both polyp histology and the surrounding mucosa.\n\u25cf\nEvaluation of polyp histology \u2013 In patients with small solitary polyps, either biopsy samples should be obtained or polypectomy performed so that the polyp can be examined microscopically for histologic characterization [7-11]. Polypectomy should be performed for all known neoplastic polyps and for all polyps \u22651 cm in diameter, as biopsies alone cannot exclude foci of high-grade dysplasia or early gastric cancer [9]. In patients with multiple polyps, the largest polyp should be excised and representative biopsies obtained from the remaining polyps [1,2].

Endomicroscopy and endocytoscopy dramatically expand the imaging capabilities of flexible endoscopy by their ability to obtain \"optical biopsies\" of nearly any accessible endoluminal surface.\nThe examinations are carried out in vivo with real-time image display. The techniques have primarily been applied to the differentiation of colon polyps and for the detection of dysplasia and neoplasia in conditions such as Barrett's esophagus and ulcerative colitis. Since the first visible neoplastic changes in epithelial cancers occur at a cellular level, these imaging techniques may allow for earlier diagnosis and treatment. In addition, confocal laser endomicroscopy and endocytoscopy may allow for targeted biopsies of abnormal mucosa, thereby decreasing the number of biopsies required to diagnose dysplasia or neoplasia while increasing diagnostic yield.\nThis topic will review confocal laser endomicroscopy and endocytoscopy, including the technical aspects of the procedures, their indications, and efficacies. Chromoendoscopy, magnification endoscopy, and narrow band imaging are discussed elsewhere. (See \"Chromoendoscopy\" and \"Magnification endoscopy\" and \"Barrett's esophagus: Evaluation with optical chromoscopy\".)\nTECHNICAL OVERVIEW\nConfocal laser endomicroscopy \u2014 Confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) is based upon the principle of illuminating a tissue with a low-power laser and then detecting fluorescent light reflected from the tissue [1]. The laser is focused at a specific depth and only light reflected back from that plane is refocused and able to pass through the pinhole confocal aperture. As a result, scattered light from above and below the plane of interest is not detected, increasing spatial resolution. The area being examined is scanned in the horizontal and vertical planes and an image is reconstructed. In this manner, microscopic imaging of biologic tissue in vivo is possible due to the high lateral resolution of confocal imaging.\nSince CLE relies upon tissue fluorescence, intravenous and/or topically applied contrast agents are required. Intravenous fluorescein is used to highlight the vasculature, lamina propria, and intracellular spaces of this tissue being examined. However, it does not stain cell nuclei. Nuclear staining can be achieved using topical contrast agents such as acriflavine and cresyl violet, but there is concern over mutagenic potential with the topical agents.

The lesions show papillary proliferation, cyst formation, and varying degrees of cellular atypia [1,2].\nIPMNs may involve the main pancreatic duct, the branch ducts, or both. Whereas patients with branch-duct lesions are at lower risk for developing malignancy (approximately 20 percent at 10 years), patients with IPMNs involving the main duct are at high risk (approximately 70 percent). As a result, these lesions need to be accurately diagnosed and characterized so that appropriate treatment can be recommended. (See \"Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm of the pancreas (IPMN): Pathophysiology and clinical manifestations\", section on 'Classification' and \"Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm of the pancreas (IPMN): Pathophysiology and clinical manifestations\", section on 'Pancreatic malignancy'.)\nThis topic will review the evaluation and management of IPMNs.

(See \"Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm of the pancreas (IPMN): Pathophysiology and clinical manifestations\" and \"Classification of pancreatic cysts\" and \"Pancreatic cystic neoplasms: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management\".)\nDIAGNOSIS\nThe approach to the diagnosis of pancreatic cystic neoplasms typically starts with cross-sectional imaging (magnetic resonance imaging with magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography or computed tomography). Additional evaluation with endoscopic ultrasound with fine-needle aspiration may be needed to confirm a diagnosis or to assess for malignant features. The diagnostic approach to pancreatic cystic neoplasms is discussed separately. (See \"Pancreatic cystic neoplasms: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management\".)\nEVALUATION FOR MALIGNANCY\nThe evaluation of a patient with an intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) aims to determine if the patient has or is at high-risk of developing a malignancy [3]. Resection is typically recommended for IPMNs with high-grade dysplasia (carcinoma in situ), IPMNs that have progressed to invasive carcinoma (also referred to as invasive IPMN or malignant IPMN), and IPMNs with features concerning for malignancy or that are at high risk for developing malignancy. IPMNs not meeting these criteria are typically followed with surveillance imaging.

AEF is defined as an abnormal connection between the aorta and the gastrointestinal tract. It is most often the result of compression of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) against (primary), or erosion of an aortic prosthetic graft into (secondary), the surrounding gastrointestinal structures.\nThe clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of AEFs are reviewed here. The management of asymptomatic and general management of symptomatic AAAs are discussed separately. (See \"Management of asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm\" and \"Management of symptomatic (non-ruptured) and ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm\".)\nDEFINITION AND CLASSIFICATION\nAEF is a rare but potentially lethal disease. AEF is defined as an abnormal communication between the aorta (or aortoiliac tree) and the gastrointestinal system. It is most frequently due to primary aortic compression (eg, abdominal aortic aneurysm) against, or erosion of an aortic prosthetic graft into, the neighboring gastrointestinal organs.\nNot all AEF are equal. Whereas intrusion into the duodenum or small bowel by a synthetic graft has been labeled an \"AEF,\" this is more of an aortic enteric erosion (AEE). While AEE may eventually lead to a full-blown AEF, the prognosis for AEE is much better than an AEF [2].\nAEFs are most commonly a communication between the aorta and the gastrointestinal tract. However, the aorta can fistulize to other organs concomitantly with the gastrointestinal tract or to other organs independent of the gastrointestinal tract [3-5].\nTo continue reading this article, you must sign in with your personal, hospital, or group practice subscription.\nSubscribe\nSign in\nDisclaimer: This generalized information is a limited summary of diagnosis, treatment, and/or medication information.

Based upon evidence-based treatment guidelines, RT is indicated in up to 60 percent of cervical cancer patients, 45 percent of endometrial cancer patients, 35 percent of vulvar cancer patients, 100 percent of vaginal cancer patients, and 5 percent of patients with ovarian cancer [1,2].\nIn this topic, the spectrum of both acute and late side effects associated with RT, specifically as it relates to the treatment of gynecologic malignancies, will be reviewed. An understanding of potential side effects is important for patient management and survivorship issues. An overview of the general principles, modalities, and techniques of RT is found elsewhere. A more detailed discussion of the indications for RT for specific cancer sites and stages can be found in topic reviews for each cancer site. (See \"Radiation therapy techniques in cancer treatment\".)\nOVERVIEW\nRT for gynecologic cancers can be employed as primary (definitive) treatment, following surgery (adjuvant), or before surgery (neoadjuvant) in order to reduce the risk of recurrence. For some tumors, RT often is administered with concurrent chemotherapy (chemoradiation) and may incorporate brachytherapy. The normal tissues of the cervix and corpus of the uterus can tolerate high doses of radiation and can recover remarkably well from radiation injury. However, the surrounding normal tissues are more susceptible to radiation injury.\nThe incidence and severity of RT side effects depend upon the site, volume of tissue exposed, and treatment schedule, including total dose, dose per fraction, and type of radiation. Modifying factors such as previous surgery, concomitant chemotherapy, and comorbid illness also are influential. At least one large report indicates that smoking history is a strong predictor for both bowel and bladder complications from treatment [3].\nSome patients may be at higher risk for RT-related toxicity.

Although the side effect liability of these drugs is significant and they are inherently associated with serious problems of substance use disorder and addiction, experience in the management of cancer pain indicates that they can potentially be used safely and effectively for all types of pain (ie, somatic, visceral, neuropathic). (See \"Cancer pain management with opioids: Optimizing analgesia\" and \"Cancer pain management: General principles and risk management for patients receiving opioids\".)\nThe term \"chronic non-cancer pain\" is ill defined but generally understood to apply to common types of musculoskeletal pain syndromes, such as arthritis and low back pain, and to headache. The long-term use of opioid drugs for these conditions is more controversial than use for cancer-related pain. For patients with chronic non-cancer pain, the decision to begin opioid therapy must be weighed carefully. (See \"Use of opioids in the management of chronic pain in adults\" and \"Pharmacologic management of chronic non-cancer pain in adults\", section on 'Opioids'.)\nThe public health consequences of opioid abuse drive the imperative that all clinicians assume responsibility for risk management when these drugs are prescribed for legitimate medical purposes. This applies to opioid use of any type in any population. (See \"Cancer pain management: General principles and risk management for patients receiving opioids\", section on 'Risk assessment and management for patients receiving opioids' and \"Opioid use disorder: Epidemiology, clinical features, health consequences, screening, and assessment\" and \"Use of opioids in the management of chronic pain in adults\", section on 'Evaluation of risk prior to initiating therapy'.)\nOpioid therapy is associated with numerous side effects, the most common of which are gastrointestinal or neurologic. There is marked interindividual variability in the sensitivity to adverse effects from opioids, which may be due to genetic differences, age, comorbidity, or interactions with other drugs. The assessment and management of side effects is a best practice during opioid therapy. In many cases, however, a favorable balance between analgesia and side effects cannot be attained, a situation that may be termed \"poor responsiveness.\" When a patient undergoing dose titration is determined be poorly responsive to a specific opioid, there are several approaches to consider: improving the symptomatic management of the dose-limiting side effect, changing to an alternative opioid (opioid rotation), or adding another therapy (a nonopioid analgesic, an adjuvant analgesic, or a nonpharmacologic treatment) that may improve analgesia even as the opioid dose is lowered.\nThis topic review will cover the prevention and management of specific adverse events in patients receiving chronic opioid therapy. Management of side effects in patients receiving opioid therapy for acute pain in the postoperative or acute critical illness settings is discussed elsewhere.

In epidemiologic studies conducted in Korea, England, and Austria, between 14 and 39 percent of the population had hemorrhoids; however, many were without symptoms [2-4]. Hemorrhoids without any symptoms do not require treatment.\nBy contrast, an estimated 10 million people in the United States complained of hemorrhoids, corresponding to a prevalence of 4.4 percent [5]. The most common complaint associated with hemorrhoidal disease is painless rectal bleeding during defecation with or without tissue prolapse. Other typical symptoms include anal pruritus or pain and a lump at the anal verge due to thrombosis or strangulation [2]. (See \"Hemorrhoids: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis\", section on 'Clinical manifestations'.)\nThose presenting for symptomatic hemorrhoids probably represent a group with relatively severe disease. Because a large variety of over-the-counter products are available and marketed for the treatment of hemorrhoids, patients often self-diagnose and self-treat before seeking medical attention. Incidentally, the quality of information about hemorrhoids on the internet is highly variable, and a significant proportion of websites assessed are poorly informed (40 percent in one study [6]).\nSeveral options are available for the treatment of symptomatic hemorrhoids, and most patients with low-grade internal hemorrhoids will have relief with home-based conservative treatment or office-based procedures that are reviewed in this topic. Surgery is indicated for low-grade hemorrhoids that are refractory to home- or office-based treatments, high-grade hemorrhoids, and complicated hemorrhoids. Surgical treatment of hemorrhoids is reviewed separately. (See \"Surgical treatment of hemorrhoidal disease\".)\nCLASSIFICATION OF HEMORRHOIDS\nHemorrhoids are classified relative to their relationship to the dentate line (figure 1):\nTo continue reading this article, you must sign in with your personal, hospital, or group practice subscription.\nSubscribe\nSign in\nDisclaimer: This generalized information is a limited summary of diagnosis, treatment, and/or medication information.

(See \"Chagas disease: Epidemiology, screening, and prevention\" and \"Chagas disease: Acute and congenital Trypanosoma cruzi infection\" and \"Chagas disease: Chronic Trypanosoma cruzi infection\" and \"Chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis\" and \"Chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy: Management and prognosis\".)\nEPIDEMIOLOGY\nAmong individuals with the chronic indeterminate form of Chagas disease, approximately 30 percent progress over a period of one to three decades to clinically evident cardiac involvement, digestive involvement, or both [2]. Gastrointestinal involvement is less common (10 to 21 percent). The mortality associated with Chagas gastrointestinal disease is low, but symptoms can considerably impact the quality of life. It is relatively rare in the setting of reactivation of chronic T. cruzi infection among organ transplant recipients or in patients with HIV infection, although there are reports of parasitic invasion of the peritoneum, intestine, stomach, esophagus, or larynx. (See \"Chagas disease in the immunosuppressed host\".)\nThe likelihood of digestive involvement may vary by region [3]. The digestive form is observed more frequently in the countries of the Southern Cone of South America and is rare in northern South America, Central America, and Mexico [4]. A high prevalence has been observed in the central region of Brazil. This geographic pattern is thought to be due to the distribution of different T. cruzi genotypes [5].\nThe burden of the gastrointestinal form can be enormous for some countries. In one study that evaluated hospitalization rates due to Chagas disease in Brazil between 2017 to 2019, there were 0.6 hospitalizations per 100,000 inhabitants, with significant regional variation. Hospitalizations increased with age and were slightly higher in males. More than 60 percent were emergencies and 50 percent were surgical procedures. In-hospital mortality was 5.8 percent and 17.2 percent went to intensive care units [6].\nTo continue reading this article, you must sign in with your personal, hospital, or group practice subscription.\nSubscribe\nSign in\nDisclaimer: This generalized information is a limited summary of diagnosis, treatment, and/or medication information.

The type of surgery depends on tumor stage and location within the rectum. Superficially invasive, small cancers may be effectively managed with limited surgery (such as local excision). However, most patients have more deeply invasive tumors that require low anterior resection or, in some cases, if located distally, abdominoperineal resection. Locally advanced tumors that are adherent or fixed to adjoining structures (eg, sacrum, pelvic sidewalls, prostate, or bladder) require more extensive surgery. (See \"Surgical treatment of rectal cancer\" and \"Treatment of locally recurrent rectal adenocarcinoma\".)\nThe combination of adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) and chemotherapy can enhance local control and cure rates in patients with either transmural invasion (T3/T4) or regional lymph node involvement (table 1). (See \"Adjuvant therapy for resected rectal adenocarcinoma in patients not receiving neoadjuvant therapy\".)\nIncreasingly, such therapy is administered preoperatively. The more favorable long-term toxicity profile and better local control with preoperative as compared with postoperative long-course chemoradiotherapy for transmural or node-positive rectal cancer were shown in the seminal German Rectal Cancer Study Group trial. Subsequently, benefit has been shown for neoadjuvant short-course RT alone, although this approach is more popular outside of the United States. More recently, the concept of \"total neoadjuvant therapy,\" in which both RT and adjuvant systemic chemotherapy are administered preoperatively, is gaining popularity for locally advanced tumors. (See \"Neoadjuvant therapy for rectal adenocarcinoma\" and \"Neoadjuvant therapy for rectal adenocarcinoma\", section on 'Total neoadjuvant therapy for locally advanced tumors'.)\nAlthough there is not universal agreement, neoadjuvant approaches are generally considered for T3/T4 and/or clinically node-positive T1/T2 tumors (table 1), distal rectal tumors (ie, tumors within 5 cm of the anal verge (figure 1)) for which preoperative chemoradiotherapy may enhance the ability to preserve the anal sphincter, and tumors that appear to invade or are in close proximity to the mesorectal fascia on preoperative imaging because of the decreased likelihood of achieving a tumor-free circumferential resection margin (CRM) with upfront surgery. (See \"Neoadjuvant therapy for rectal adenocarcinoma\", section on 'Indications for neoadjuvant therapy'.)\nThe selection of appropriate patients for initial RT or chemoradiotherapy rather than surgery is heavily dependent on accurate preoperative locoregional staging of the depth of transmural penetration, the presence or absence of suspicious perirectal nodes, and the likely status of the CRM. Locoregional tumor staging is mainly accomplished through physical examination, endoscopy, computed tomography (CT) scans, magnetic resonance imaging, and transrectal endoscopic ultrasound (TEUS).\nTo continue reading this article, you must sign in with your personal, hospital, or group practice subscription.\nSubscribe\nSign in\nDisclaimer: This generalized information is a limited summary of diagnosis, treatment, and/or medication information.

Colonoscopy is a safe procedure that provides information other tests may not be able to give.\nColonoscopy is performed by inserting a device called a colonoscope into the anus and advancing through the entire colon (figure 1). The procedure generally takes between 20 minutes and one hour.\nOther tests that are sometimes used to screen for colon cancer, like virtual colonoscopy (also called CT colonography), are discussed separately. (See \"Patient education: Screening for colorectal cancer (Beyond the Basics)\".)\nMore detailed information about colonoscopy is available by subscription. (See \"Tests for screening for colorectal cancer\".)\nREASONS FOR COLONOSCOPY\nThe most common reasons for colonoscopy are:\n\u25cf\nTo screen for colon polyps (growths of tissue in the colon) or colon cancer\n\u25cf\nRectal bleeding\n\u25cf\nA change in bowel habits, like persistent diarrhea\n\u25cf\nIron deficiency anemia (a decrease in blood count due to loss of iron\n\u25cf\nChronic, unexplained abdominal or rectal pain\n\u25cf\nAn abnormal x-ray exam, like a barium enema or CT scan\nThe timing of colonoscopy generally depends on risk factors such as having a family history of colon cancer or polyps or having a personal history of colon cancer or polyps.\nCOLONOSCOPY PREPARATION\nBefore colonoscopy, your colon must be completely cleaned out so that the doctor can see any abnormal areas. This is vitally important to increase the chances that your doctor will identify abnormalities in your colon. If your colon is not completely cleaned out, the chances your doctor will miss abnormalities increases. Your doctor's office will provide specific instructions about how you should prepare for your colonoscopy. Be sure to read these instructions as soon as you get them so you will know how to take the preparation and whether you need to make any changes to your medications or diet. If you have questions, call the doctor's office in advance.\nYou will need to avoid solid food for at least one day before the test. You should also drink plenty of clear fluids on the day before the test. You can drink clear liquids (a liquid you can hold up to the light and see through) up to several hours before your procedure, including:\n\u25cf\nWater\n\u25cf\nClear broth (beef, chicken, or vegetable)\n\u25cf\nCoffee or tea (without milk)\n\u25cf\nFlavored ices\n\u25cf\nGelatin such as Jell-O (avoid red gelatin)\nAvoid drinking red liquids. Your doctor may also ask you to avoid high fiber foods including seeds and nuts for the week before the procedure.\nTo clean the colon, you will take a strong laxative and empty your bowels. You may be asked to take the entire preparation the night before the test, or you may be asked to take it in two doses, with the second dose taken four to six hours prior to the colonoscopy. Taking the preparation in two \"split\" doses may help get the colon even cleaner. This may require you to wake up early in the morning to complete the preparation. You may even be able to drink the entire solution the morning of the procedure if you are having the colonoscopy in the afternoon. The instructions you are given will tell you how you should take the preparation.\nOne type of preparation is a four-liter (one gallon) solution that you buy at the pharmacy with a prescription. Several lower-volume (two- to three-liter) preparations are on the market as well. Another option is citrate of magnesia (also called magnesium citrate), a 300 mL (10 ounce) bottle that requires no mixing and is over-the-counter. Packets of powdered laxative are available that are mixed with a smaller volume of water. Pill-based preparations are also available but usually require swallowing 24 pills with a large amount of water.\nRefrigerating the solution can make it easier to drink, but do not put ice in the solution since it will melt and you will have to drink even more fluid. Drinking the solution through a straw, adding sugar-free powdered flavor packets (eg, Crystal Light), and taking half the preparation the night before and the other half later (four to six hours before your colonoscopy) may also make it easier to drink. Drinking this solution may be the most unpleasant part of the exam. Watery diarrhea is the desired result. This may occur shortly after drinking the solution or may be delayed for several hours. The end result should be diarrhea that looks like urine. If you become nauseated or vomit while drinking the solution, call your doctor or nurse for instructions. Tips that can help with nausea and vomiting include temporarily stopping drinking the solution, walking around, and resuming drinking at a slower pace.\nMedicines \u2014 You can take most prescription and nonprescription medicines right up to the day of the colonoscopy. Your doctor should tell you what medicines to stop. If you are taking certain medications for diabetes or obesity, these may need to be temporarily stopped before the procedure. Examples include glucagon like peptide (GLP)-1 agonists like dulaglutide (brand name: Trulicity) and sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT)-2 inhibitors like empagliflozin (brand name: Jardiance). Please ask your doctor what to do with these medications before your colonoscopy. You should also tell the doctor if you are allergic to any medicines.\nSome medicines increase the risk of heavy bleeding if you have a polyp removed during the colonoscopy. Ask your doctor how and when to stop these medicines, including warfarin (brand name: Jantoven), clopidogrel (brand name: Plavix), or any other antithrombotic (\u201cblood thinner\u201d) medicine. Do not stop these medications without first talking with your doctor.\nTransportation home \u2014 Most patients are given a sedative (a medicine to help you relax) during the colonoscopy, so you will need someone to take you home after your test. An anesthesiologist may give the sedative and monitor you during the colonoscopy. Although you will be awake by the time you go home, the sedative/anesthetic medicines cause changes in reflexes and judgment that can interfere with your ability to make decisions, similar to the effect of alcohol. You will not be able to drive home or go back to work immediately after the procedure if you received sedation for the procedure. You should be able to return to work the next day.\nWHAT TO EXPECT\nBefore the test, a doctor will review the procedure with you, including possible complications, and ask you to sign a consent form.\nAn IV line will be inserted in your hand or arm. Your blood pressure, heart rate, and breathing will be monitored during the test.\nTHE COLONOSCOPY PROCEDURE\nYou will be given fluid and medicines through the IV line. With sedation/analgesia provided during the colonoscopy, many people sleep during the test, while others are very relaxed, comfortable, and generally not aware. Your doctor may request an anesthesiologist give you an anesthetic agent (for example, propofol), which is a stronger sedative and will put you to sleep while you are being closely monitored.\nThe colonoscope is a long black flexible tube, approximately the diameter of the index finger. The doctor will gently pump air or carbon dioxide and sterile water or saline through the scope into the colon to inflate it and allow the doctor to see the entire lining. You might feel bloating or gas cramps as the air opens the colon. Try not to be embarrassed about passing this gas (it is just air), and let your doctor know if you are uncomfortable. You may feel like you have to go to the bathroom, which is a normal feeling during the procedure.\nDuring the procedure, the doctor might take a biopsy (small pieces of tissue) or remove polyps. Polyps are growths of tissue that can range in size from the tip of a pen to several inches. Most polyps are benign (not cancerous). However, some polyps can become cancerous if allowed to grow for a long time. Having a polyp removed does not hurt. (See \"Patient education: Colon polyps (Beyond the Basics)\" and \"Endoscopic removal of large colon polyps\".)\nRECOVERY FROM COLONOSCOPY\nAfter the colonoscopy, you will be observed in a recovery area, usually for about 30 to 60 minutes until the effects of the sedative medication wear off. The most common complaint after colonoscopy is a feeling of bloating and gas cramps. You should pass gas and not feel embarrassed doing this either during or after the procedure. This will relieve your feelings of bloating and cramping. You may also feel groggy from the sedation medications. You should not return to work, drive, or drink alcohol that day. Most people are able to eat normally after the test. Ask your doctor when it is safe to restart aspirin and other blood-thinning medications.\nCOLONOSCOPY COMPLICATIONS\nColonoscopy is a safe procedure, and complications are rare but can occur:\n\u25cf\nBleeding can occur from biopsies or the removal of polyps, but it is usually minimal and can be controlled.\n\u25cf\nThe colonoscope can cause a tear or hole in the colon. This is a serious problem that sometimes requires surgery to repair, but it does not happen commonly.\n\u25cf\nIt is possible to have side effects from the sedative medicines like nausea or vomiting.\n\u25cf\nAlthough colonoscopy is the best test to examine the colon, it is possible for even the most skilled doctors to miss or overlook an abnormal area in the colon.\nYou should call your doctor immediately if you have any of the following:\n\u25cf\nSevere abdominal pain (not just gas cramps)\n\u25cf\nA firm, bloated abdomen\n\u25cf\nVomiting\n\u25cf\nFever\n\u25cf\nA lot of rectal bleeding or clumps of blood\nAFTER COLONOSCOPY\nAlthough many people worry about being uncomfortable during a colonoscopy, most people tolerate it very well and feel fine afterward. It is normal to feel tired afterward. Plan to take it easy and relax the rest of the day.\nYour doctor can describe the results of the colonoscopy as soon as it is over. If your doctor took biopsies or removed polyps, you should call for results within two weeks if your doctor has not already contacted you.\nWHERE TO GET MORE INFORMATION\nYour healthcare provider is the best source of information for questions and concerns related to your medical problem.\nThis article will be updated as needed on our website (www.uptodate.com/patients).

Limited views of the esophagus, stomach, and cecum may also be acquired by small bowel capsules. Images acquired are of excellent resolution and have an approximately 1:8 magnification, which is higher than that of conventional endoscopes. This magnification allows visualization of individual villi. VCE approaches the concept of physiological endoscopy since the capsule moves passively, does not inflate the bowel, and images most of the small intestinal mucosa. Double-ended wireless video capsules have also been developed for the examination of the colon.\nA long-awaited artificial intelligence assistant that speeds up the reading of video capsules has also been FDA approved. In addition, a magnetically controllable capsule has become available, along with a tether for examination of the esophagus and stomach.\nThis topic will review the use of wireless video capsule endoscopy for evaluation of the esophagus, small bowel, and colon. The general approaches to patients with occult and/or suspected small bowel bleeding are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See \"Evaluation of occult gastrointestinal bleeding\" and \"Evaluation of suspected small bowel bleeding (formerly obscure gastrointestinal bleeding)\".)\nAVAILABLE CAPSULES\nSeveral small intestinal video capsules are available and FDA approved in the United States (table 1):\n\u25cf\nPillCam SB3 and the Crohn\u2019s capsule (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN)\nTo continue reading this article, you must sign in with your personal, hospital, or group practice subscription.\nSubscribe\nSign in\nDisclaimer: This generalized information is a limited summary of diagnosis, treatment, and/or medication information.

The cardinal features of hemorrhoidal disease include bleeding, anal pruritus, prolapse, and pain due to thrombosis. This topic will review the anatomic classification, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of hemorrhoids. The management of hemorrhoids are discussed in detail, separately. (See \"Home and office treatment of symptomatic hemorrhoids\" and \"Surgical treatment of hemorrhoidal disease\".)\nANATOMY AND CLASSIFICATION\nHemorrhoids arise from a plexus or cushion of dilated arteriovenous channels and connective tissue. Hemorrhoidal veins are normal anatomic structures located in the submucosal layer in the lower rectum and may be external or internal based upon whether they are below or above the dentate line. Both types of hemorrhoids often coexist. Internal and external hemorrhoids communicate with one another and drain into the internal pudendal veins, and ultimately, the inferior vena cava.\nInternal hemorrhoids \u2014 Internal hemorrhoids are proximal to or above the dentate line. Internal hemorrhoids arise from the superior hemorrhoidal cushion. Their three primary locations (left lateral, right anterior, and right posterior) correspond to the end branches of the middle and superior hemorrhoidal veins. The overlying columnar epithelium is viscerally innervated; therefore, these hemorrhoids are not sensitive to pain, touch, or temperature. Tissues above the dentate line receive visceral innervation, which is less sensitive to pain and irritation. Internal hemorrhoids are further subclassified into four grades based on the degree of prolapse from the anal canal.\nInternal hemorrhoids are graded according to the degree to which they prolapse from the anal canal:\n\u25cf\nGrade I hemorrhoids are visualized on anoscopy and may bulge into the lumen but do not prolapse below the dentate line.\nTo continue reading this article, you must sign in with your personal, hospital, or group practice subscription.\nSubscribe\nSign in\nDisclaimer: This generalized information is a limited summary of diagnosis, treatment, and/or medication information.

For more information, please visit www.lww.com.\n\"If a patient asks a medical practitioner for help, the doctor does the best he can. He is not responsible for defects in medical knowledge. If, however, the practitioner initiates screening procedures, he is in a very different situation. He should have conclusive evidence that screening can alter the natural history of disease in a significant proportion of those screened.\"\nArchie Cochrane and Walter Holland, 1971\nMost doctors are attracted to medicine because they look forward to curing disease. But all things considered, most people would prefer never to contract a disease in the first place; or, if they cannot avoid an illness, they prefer that it be caught early and stamped out before it causes them any harm. To accomplish this, people without specific complaints undergo interventions to identify and modify risk factors to avoid the onset of disease or to find disease early in its course so that early treatment prevents illness. When these interventions take place in clinical practice, the activity is referred to as preventive care.\nPreventive care constitutes a large portion of clinical practice [1]. Clinicians should understand its conceptual basis and content. They should be prepared to answer questions from patients such as, \"How much exercise do I need, Doctor?\" or \"I heard that a study showed antioxidants were not helpful in preventing heart disease. What do you think?\" or \"There was a newspaper ad for a calcium scan. Do you think I should get one?\"\nTo continue reading this article, you must sign in with your personal, hospital, or group practice subscription.\nSubscribe\nSign in\nDisclaimer: This generalized information is a limited summary of diagnosis, treatment, and/or medication information.

(See \"Primary sclerosing cholangitis: Epidemiology and pathogenesis\".)\nPSC is associated with numerous complications, including cholestasis (with associated problems), dominant stricture formation, cholelithiasis and cholangitis, cholangiocarcinoma, and colon cancer (in patients with concurrent ulcerative colitis) [2,3].

FMT protocols vary between institutions, and comparative efficacy studies are few and underpowered.\nAvailable data are strongest for use of FMT in the setting of recurrent CDI; recurrent CDI is defined by complete abatement of CDI symptoms while on appropriate therapy, followed by reappearance of symptoms within two to eight weeks after treatment has been stopped [2]. Recurrent CDI occurs in 10 to 25 percent of patients treated with antimicrobial therapy.\nData on additional circumstances in which FMT may be beneficial, such as severe and fulminant CDI, are limited and are discussed elsewhere. (See \"Clostridioides difficile infection in adults: Treatment and prevention\".)\nIssues related to FMT are reviewed here. Other issues related to CDI are discussed separately.

B. coli generally occurs among domestic and wild mammals, especially among pigs in warmer climates and monkeys in the tropics. Infection in humans is therefore also more common in pig farmers and pig-raising regions, especially in settings where hygiene is poor [2,3]. Camels, cattle, donkey, sheep, and goat may also be reservoirs for human infection [4]. Animal fecal contamination of water or food consumed by humans is the principal means for acquisition of infection by humans [5-7]. Transmission between humans can occur via the fecal-oral route.\nTransmission of balantidiasis occurs via ingestion of cysts (figure 1). Following ingestion, excystation occurs in the small intestine, and the trophozoites colonize the large intestine. The trophozoites reside in the lumen of the large intestine of humans and animals, where they replicate by binary fission; conjugation may also occur. Trophozoites undergo encystation to produce infective cysts. Some trophozoites invade the wall of the colon and multiply; some return to the lumen and disintegrate. Mature cysts are passed in the stool and can remain viable for up to two weeks in the environment [8]. Cysts are considered the main infective stage; trophozoites can also be passed in stool but generally disappear soon after passage [4].\nCLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS\nThree forms of B. coli infection can occur: asymptomatic cyst excretion, acute colitis, and chronic infection [9-11]. Most cases are asymptomatic; patients with comorbidities (particularly immunosuppression) or other infections are at increased risk for developing symptomatic infection [12-14].\nIn sporadic cases with acute clinical manifestations, symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss, and abdominal pain. Stools may be either watery or dysenteric [10]. Fulminant disease is rare and is most frequently associated with fulminating dysentery with or without multiple intestinal perforations. When present, the colonic ulcers and clinical presentation are similar to those found in amebic dysentery with deep invasion of the submucosa with organisms. Microperforations with resulting sepsis can be a potentially fatal complication.\nTo continue reading this article, you must sign in with your personal, hospital, or group practice subscription.\nSubscribe\nSign in\nDisclaimer: This generalized information is a limited summary of diagnosis, treatment, and/or medication information.

HDGC is defined by the presence of a pathogenic germline variant in the cadherin 1 (CDH1) or alpha-1 catenin (also known as alpha-E-catenin; CTNNA1) gene in either an isolated individual with DGC, or in a family with one or more DGC cases in first-degree or second-degree relatives [1]. Lobular breast cancer and nonsyndromic cleft lip/palate are also part of the HDGC syndrome. The term hereditary lobular breast cancer (HLBC) has been proposed as the presence of a pathogenic germline CDH1 variant in either an isolated individual with LBC, or a family with one or more LBC cases in first-degree or second-degree relatives, but no known DGC in either situation.\nThese pathogenic variants are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. The lifetime risk of gastric cancer in individuals from families with pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in CDH1 is very high, and diagnosis has been made in individuals in their teens and early 20s. As a result, prophylactic total gastrectomy (PTG) is usually advised, generally between ages 20 and 30. Recommendations are less clear for those with pathogenic or likely pathogenic CTNNA1 variants, as penetrance is uncertain.\nThis topic will provide a detailed overview of HDGC, focusing on the identification of high-risk families and genetic counseling and testing. The pathology and molecular pathogenesis of this disorder and technical aspects of PTG for patients with HDGC are presented separately. (See \"Gastric cancer: Pathology and molecular pathogenesis\" and \"Surgical management of hereditary diffuse gastric cancer\".)\nMOLECULAR GENETICS\nHDGC is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait with high penetrance. The pathogenic germline variants occur in one of two genes, CDH1 and CTNNA1.\nCDH1 \u2014 Germline truncating pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants of the cadherin 1 (CDH1) gene, located on chromosome 16q22.1, were originally described in three Maori families from New Zealand that were predisposed to DGC. Subsequently, germline CDH1 pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants have been identified in approximately 15 to 50 percent of affected kindreds that meet the historic clinical criteria for HDGC, initially defined by the International Gastric Cancer Linkage Consortium (IGCLC) [2].\nTo continue reading this article, you must sign in with your personal, hospital, or group practice subscription.\nSubscribe\nSign in\nDisclaimer: This generalized information is a limited summary of diagnosis, treatment, and/or medication information.

Prior to the availability of potent antiretroviral therapy (ART), CMV gastrointestinal disease occurred in up to 5 percent of patients with AIDS, primarily in those with advanced immunosuppression. However, the incidence of CMV gastrointestinal disease has decreased substantially since ART became available [1,2]. (See \"Selecting antiretroviral regimens for treatment-na\u00efve persons with HIV-1: General approach\".)\nA discussion of the pathogenesis and clinical manifestations of other CMV-related diseases in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is found elsewhere. (See \"AIDS-related cytomegalovirus neurologic disease\" and \"Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of AIDS-related cytomegalovirus retinitis\".)\nNATURAL HISTORY\nIn persons with prior CMV infection and a CD4 cell count <50 cells/microL, reactivation of latent virus causes a systemic disease that is characterized by intermittent or constant viremia which can lead to colonization or localized infections in one or multiple target organs, including the gastrointestinal tract [3]. CMV gastrointestinal disease was first reported as a manifestation of AIDS in 1983. In early case series, patients generally died within several months without CMV-specific treatment, and hemorrhage or perforation often complicated the course of disease. The prognosis of such patients remained poor despite the advent of antiviral drugs for the treatment of CMV. As an example, the median survival was reported to be four months after the diagnosis of CMV colitis and eight months after CMV esophagitis, even with ganciclovir therapy [4-6]. However, as with all HIV-related opportunistic infections, the prognosis has improved markedly with the utilization of antiretroviral therapy (ART). (See 'Impact of ART' below.)\nRisk factors \u2014 Most cases of CMV disease occur in the setting of advanced immunosuppression, with CD4 cell counts < 50 cells/microL [7]. The presence of CMV in blood (as measured by culture, CMV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) amplification, or antigen detection) is also a risk factor for the development of invasive disease [8]. However, patients with viremia may not have invasive disease. (See 'Viral detection' below.)\nImpact of ART \u2014 The prognosis of patients with AIDS and CMV gastrointestinal disease has improved dramatically since effective ART became available in the late 1990s [9,10]. Most cases of end organ disease now occur in patients who are not receiving ART, either due to late diagnosis of HIV disease or poor adherence to prescribed therapy.\nTo continue reading this article, you must sign in with your personal, hospital, or group practice subscription.\nSubscribe\nSign in\nDisclaimer: This generalized information is a limited summary of diagnosis, treatment, and/or medication information.

Dental abnormalities, desmoid tumors, and other lesions were later recognized as additional manifestations of the underlying genetic defect [3,4]. The constellation of inherited colonic adenomatosis together with these extracolonic lesions has become known as Gardner syndrome (GS).\nThis topic review will discuss each of the extraintestinal manifestations of FAP that historically have defined GS. Gastric, duodenal, and colonic polyp and cancer issues are discussed in a separate section on FAP. Genetic testing is now also available for FAP and GS since both arise from mutations of the same gene [5]. It should be noted that GS is now considered a subcategory of FAP, characterized by the extraintestinal manifestations to be reviewed below that occur in addition to the intestinal polyposis of FAP. Issues related to genetic testing are also presented in the section on FAP. (See \"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of familial adenomatous polyposis\" and \"Familial adenomatous polyposis: Screening and management of patients and families\".)\nDEFINITIONS\nShortly after discovery of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene, the gene responsible for familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), it became apparent that both FAP and Gardner syndrome (GS) arose from APC mutations [3,4]. FAP is characterized by hundreds to thousands of colonic adenomatous polyps that most often emerge in the second and third decades of life. Colon cancer is inevitable if the colon is not removed. Polyposis is also usually observed in the stomach, duodenum, and small bowel, although the cancer risk in these locations is far less than in the colon. Inheritance is autosomal dominant with near complete penetrance of the gastrointestinal phenotype but with variable penetrance of the extraintestinal manifestations of the disease [6]. The APC protein is a complex scaffolding protein (brings together two or more proteins) with multiple domains relating to cell migration, cell adhesion, cell proliferation, cell differentiation, and microtubule binding that is involved in chromosomal segregation and mitotic progression. These multiple functional relationships contribute to the many intestinal and extra-intestinal manifestations of FAP/GS [7].\nGS cannot be separated from FAP when considering studies that describe its overall prevalence. Estimates for the prevalence of the combined syndromes vary from 1 in 6850 to 1 in 31,250 people (2.29 to 3.2 cases per 100,000 persons) [8-10]. Prevalence appears fairly constant throughout the world with males and females affected equally. Twenty to 30 percent of newly diagnosed cases, ie, those not belonging to previously identified families, appear to represent new mutations [8]. New cases may also arise from mosaic inheritance, which implies that a mutation occurred in parent's sperm or egg cells, but not in other cells of the body, so the parent did not have clinical disease [11,12].\nIt was once believed that GS patients exhibited fewer and more distinct colonic polyps. However, continued study has demonstrated that the gastrointestinal polyp and cancer phenotypes, although variable, are identical for both GS and FAP. Colonic polyp number depends to some degree on where the mutation occurs in the APC gene [13]. Mutations in the center of the gene (often called the mutation cluster region) give rise to dense polyposis, with 5000 or more colonic polyps [14] when the disease is fully developed. If mutations occur proximal or distal to this central gene location, colonic polyps average approximately 1000 with full expression. Mutations in the extreme proximal or distal locations of the APC gene, or in certain areas of exon nine, are associated with many fewer polyps (often less than 100). This clinical variation is referred to as attenuated FAP. Extraintestinal growths also occur in the attenuated form of FAP, do not correlate with polyp density but have some correlation with mutation location [3,14,15].\nTo continue reading this article, you must sign in with your personal, hospital, or group practice subscription.\nSubscribe\nSign in\nDisclaimer: This generalized information is a limited summary of diagnosis, treatment, and/or medication information.

        "article_text": "View in\nLanguage\n Chinese\nEnglish\nAUTHOR:Diane Abraczinskas, MDSECTION EDITOR:Nicholas J Talley, MD, PhDDEPUTY EDITOR:Zehra Hussain, MD, FACP\nLiterature review current through: Sep 2024.\nThis topic last updated: Oct 04, 2024.\nINTRODUCTION\nA variety of gastrointestinal complaints, such as belching, bloating, abdominal pain, and flatulence, are commonly attributed by the patient to \"excess gas,\" even though this perception is usually incorrect. When excessive intestinal gas does occur, it may be due to excessive air swallowing, increased intraluminal production from malabsorbed nutrients, decreased gas absorption due to obstruction or dysfunctional gas clearance, or expansion of intraluminal gas due to changes in atmospheric pressure. This topic will review the evaluation and management of patients with predominant symptoms of belching, flatulence, abdominal bloating, and distension. Other functional gastrointestinal disorders associated with these symptoms are discussed in detail separately. (See \"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome in adults\" and \"Functional dyspepsia in adults\" and \"Etiology and evaluation of chronic constipation in adults\", section on 'Etiology and pathogenesis'.)\nPATHOPHYSIOLOGY\nVolume and composition of intestinal gas \u2014 The understanding of intestinal gas syndromes has been aided by studies of intestinal gas composition and volume in asymptomatic individuals and in those with complaints of intestinal gas. The volume of gas in the intestinal tract is approximately 200 mL in both the fasting and postprandial states in both normal subjects and individuals who complain of gaseous distension [1-4]. Nitrogen (N2), oxygen (O2), carbon dioxide (CO2), hydrogen (H2), and methane (CH4) account for more than 99 percent of expelled intestinal gas [1]. The composition of gas within the intestinal tract is predominantly N2 [1]. Oxygen is present in very low concentrations, and the concentrations of CO2, H2, and CH4 vary among individuals.\nThe composition of gas also varies within sections of the gastrointestinal tract. As an example, stomach gas contains high concentrations of N2 and O2 similar to the atmosphere, while flatus contains less O2 and more CH4. None of the principal gases has an odor. Minor constituents of flatus, to which odor may be attributable, include sulfur-containing compounds such as methanethiol, dimethyl sulfide, hydrogen sulfide, as well as short-chain fatty acids, skatoles, indoles, volatile amines, and ammonia [5,6].\nSources of intestinal gas\nAir swallowing \u2014 Air swallowing (aerophagia) is the major source of stomach gas. Several milliliters of air are ingested in each normal swallow and with gum chewing and smoking. Larger amounts are swallowed when food is gulped. Aerophagia is also a manifestation of anxiety. Most swallowed air appears to be eructated [7].\nSwallowed air is the major source of O2 and N2 in intestinal gas. Posture may influence the amount of swallowed air passing from the stomach into the small intestine.

IrAEs include dermatologic, gastrointestinal, hepatic, endocrine, and other less common inflammatory events. IrAEs are believed to arise from general immunologic enhancement, and temporary immunosuppression with glucocorticoids, tumor necrosis factor-alpha antagonists, mycophenolate mofetil, or other agents can be an effective treatment in most cases. Although rare, fulminant and even fatal toxicities may occur with ICIs [3,4].

IPMNs have also been referred to as mucinous duct ectasias and intraductal papillary mucinous tumors. IPMNs are potentially malignant intraductal epithelial neoplasms that are grossly visible (>1 cm) and are composed of mucin-producing columnar cells. The lesions show papillary proliferation, cyst formation, and varying degrees of cellular atypia [4,5]. IPMNs may involve the main pancreatic duct, the branch ducts, or both. (See \"Classification of pancreatic cysts\".)\nThis topic will review the pathophysiology and clinical manifestations of IPMNs. The diagnosis and treatment of IPMNs, as well as an overview of pancreatic cystic neoplasms, are presented separately. (See \"Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm of the pancreas (IPMN): Evaluation and management\" and \"Classification of pancreatic cysts\" and \"Pancreatic cystic neoplasms: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management\".)\nEPIDEMIOLOGY\nIntraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm of the pancreas (IPMN) was first described in 1982 when four patients with pancreatic carcinoma and favorable outcomes were reported. The patients were noted to have dilated main pancreatic ducts, patulous ampullary orifices, and mucus secretion from the pancreatic duct. With time, the incidence of IPMN has increased, largely due to increased diagnosis [6]. Prior to 1999, the distinction between IPMN and mucinous cystic neoplasm had not been clarified, so many lesions previously classified as MCNs may have, in fact, been IPMNs. In addition, improvements in imaging technology have led to more accurate identification of cystic pancreatic lesions.\nThe true incidence of IPMN is not known because many IPMNs are small and asymptomatic. A series of 2832 consecutive computed tomography scans performed in adults without a history of pancreatic lesions or factors predisposing to pancreatic disease found pancreatic cysts in 73 (2.6 percent) [7]. In a similar study of 616 consecutive patients undergoing magnetic resonance imaging, the incidence of pancreatic cysts was higher (13.5 percent), with a median diameter of 6 mm [8]. Many of these were likely IPMNs since it is thought that IPMNs account for 1 to 3 percent of exocrine pancreatic neoplasms and 20 to 50 percent of cystic pancreatic neoplasms [9-11].\nThe male-to-female ratio for main duct IPMN has varied in reports from 1.1 to 3:1, and for branch duct IPMN it has varied from 0.7 to 1.8:1 [12]. The ratio varies geographically, with a male predominance in Japan and Korea and a more even distribution or female predominance in the United States and Europe. The typical age at presentation is in the fifth to seventh decade [13] (table 1).\nTo continue reading this article, you must sign in with your personal, hospital, or group practice subscription.\nSubscribe\nSign in\nDisclaimer: This generalized information is a limited summary of diagnosis, treatment, and/or medication information.

The average life expectancy at birth has increased from 47 years in 1900 to nearly 79 years in 2014. By 2030, the percentage of the population over 65 years of age will exceed 20 percent, or over 70 million people [1]. Worldwide, the number of adults over 60 years of age will top 2 billion by 2050 and will constitute over 20 percent of the world's population [2].\nDefinitions of health and wellbeing in late life have changed with the increase in life expectancy. Heart disease, cancer, and stroke have become the leading causes of death among older adults, while deaths due to infection have decreased. Adults surviving into late life suffer from high rates of chronic illness; 80 percent have at least one and 50 percent have at least two chronic conditions [1]. There is a strong association between the presence of geriatric syndromes (cognitive impairment, falls, incontinence, vision or hearing impairment, low body mass index, dizziness) and dependency in activities of daily living [3].\nDecline in function and loss of independence are not an inevitable consequence of aging. Given the high prevalence and impact of chronic health problems among older patients, evidence-based interventions to address these problems become increasingly important to maximize both the quantity and quality of life for older adults.\nThis topic offers a brief discussion of office-based assessments to identify and address common problems that are amenable to prevention or amelioration in older adults. It also provides descriptions and tools useful in performing the assessments contained in the Medicare Initial Preventive Physical Examination (IPPE).

Affected individuals are heterozygous for a pathogenic variant in COL3A1.\nEvaluation and management of VEDS are discussed in detail separately. (See 'Resources' below.)\nClinical characteristics of VEDS \u2014 There are 13 different types of EDS with different genetic causes and different clinical characteristics (table 1). (See \"Ehlers-Danlos syndromes: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis\", section on 'Classification'.)\nNeonates may present with clubfoot, hip dislocation, and/or amniotic bands [2]. Unless identified as part of a family study or known family history of the condition, presentation in most individuals who are unaware of their diagnosis occurs in early adulthood (late 20s to early 30s) with a major complication, with a small proportion presenting in childhood [3,4].\nPresenting findings can be catastrophic, including sudden death, shock, stroke, acute abdomen due to intestinal perforation or rupture, or uterine rupture during delivery. There is a 5 percent risk of maternal death during pregnancy, although pregnancy does not appear to affect overall survival in VEDS [5]. This risk estimate is probably biased by ascertainment at the time of complications or death in the largest series.\nTo continue reading this article, you must sign in with your personal, hospital, or group practice subscription.\nSubscribe\nSign in\nDisclaimer: This generalized information is a limited summary of diagnosis, treatment, and/or medication information.

The patient is treated with warfarin and clopidogrel for cardiac indications. He has had recurrent GI bleeding requiring intermittent blood transfusions for approximately six months. The site of the bleeding has eluded diagnosis despite upper GI endoscopy, colonoscopy, and capsule enteroscopy. The patient has had type 2 diabetes for 23 years and has been on insulin for 11 years. His diabetes is complicated by retinopathy, peripheral neuropathy, and chronic kidney disease. The patient has rheumatic heart disease, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. He has had mitral and aortic valve replacements and recent placement of a stent in the left anterior descending artery. The estimated left ventricular ejection fraction is 26 percent. On the day of discharge from the hospital, the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) was 66 mg/dL, creatinine 2.2 mg/dL, international normalized ratio (INR) 2.4, and glycated hemoglobin (A1C) 5.40 percent. His medications include NPH insulin 58 units every morning and 24 units every day at bedtime. He is also on furosemide 120 mg twice a day, potassium chloride 20 mEq twice a day, spironolactone 50 mg once a day, metolazone 5 mg every other day, esomeprazole 40 mg a day, warfarin 4 mg a day, and clopidogrel 75 mg a day. He has been eating regularly and checking his blood glucose level at home since discharge. The glucose values before breakfast have been 131 to 152 mg /dL (7.3 to 8.4 mmol/L), and those before supper have been 143 to 197 mg/dL (7.9 to 10.9 mmol/L).\nHow would you manage the patient's diabetes at this time?\n\u25cf\nReduce insulin doses by 50 percent because the A1C indicates excessively tight management in this patient, in whom hypoglycemia is of more than the usual concern because of his cardiovascular disease. (See \"Interactive diabetes case 7: Management of diabetes in a 72-year-old patient with type 2 diabetes, GI bleeding, and multiple other medical problems \u2013 A1\".)\n\u25cf\nStop insulin to avert hypoglycemia in this patient, in whom hypoglycemia is of more than the usual concern because of his cardiovascular disease, and begin glyburide 10 mg before breakfast and 10 mg before supper to provide more gentle control of the diabetes. (See \"Interactive diabetes case 7: Management of diabetes in a 72-year-old patient with type 2 diabetes, GI bleeding, and multiple other medical problems \u2013 A2\".)\n\u25cf\nStop insulin to avert hypoglycemia in this patient, in whom hypoglycemia is of more than the usual concern because of his cardiovascular disease, and begin metformin 1000 mg before breakfast and supper to manage diabetes without the risk of hypoglycemia.

OSP was formerly sold without prescription under the brand name \"Fleet Phospho-soda\" (C.B. Fleet Inc). Fleet no longer distributes OSP; however, generic versions of OSP are still available without prescription. OSP is also available by prescription in a pill form (Visicol, OsmoPrep). In both pill and liquid form, OSP is a hyperosmotic laxative that acts by drawing water into the gastrointestinal tract. Although long used as a laxative, OSP began to be used as a purgative for colonoscopy in 1990 [3]. It is frequently given in favor of standard polyethylene glycol (PEG)-based lavage solutions because of the smaller required volume, which results in better patient compliance and improved colonic cleansing [4-6].\nHowever, there have been multiple cases of OSP-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) with defining histologic features on biopsy [7-11]. This clinicopathologic entity has been referred to as acute phosphate nephropathy.\nIn 2006, in response to published reports, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a warning regarding the potential for AKI in patients who received OSP [12]. The warning was incorporated into a consensus document on bowel preparation by the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons (ASCRS), the American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE), and the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES) [13]. In December 2008, the FDA required that a boxed warning be added to labeling of Visicol and OsmoPrep, which are still available by prescription [14]. At the same time, following the recommendation of the FDA, over-the-counter preparations that contain OSP were voluntarily withdrawn from the market by Fleet; but, as noted above, generic versions are still available. In 2014, the FDA issued another warning that using more than one dose in 24 hours of OSP to treat constipation can cause \"rare but serious harm to the kidneys and heart, and even death\" [15].\nThis topic provides a review of the clinical features of acute phosphate nephropathy. AKI associated with an increased phosphate load has also been described in tumor lysis syndrome, especially with alkalinization of the urine by bicarbonate-containing intravenous (IV) fluids. Tumor lysis syndrome is discussed elsewhere. (See \"Tumor lysis syndrome: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, definition, etiology and risk factors\".)\nPATHOGENESIS\nThe mechanism underlying acute phosphate nephropathy most likely relates to a transient but potentially severe increase in serum phosphate coupled with volume depletion, both of which may occur following the administration of bowel purgatives that contain oral sodium phosphate (OSP).\nTo continue reading this article, you must sign in with your personal, hospital, or group practice subscription.\nSubscribe\nSign in\nDisclaimer: This generalized information is a limited summary of diagnosis, treatment, and/or medication information.

It may be transient or chronic and difficult to treat. This topic will review the etiology, diagnostic approach, and management of patients with anal pruritus.\nEPIDEMIOLOGY\nAnal pruritus is estimated to affect 1 to 5 percent of the general population [1]. However, most of these patients probably do not come to medical attention. Anal pruritus is more common in the fourth to sixth decades of life and has a higher prevalence in males [2].\nETIOLOGY\nApproximately 75 percent of cases of anal pruritus are secondary to inflammatory, infectious, systemic, neoplastic, and anorectal disorders that contribute to or underlie the development of pruritus [2,3]. Idiopathic anal pruritus likely results from perianal fecal contamination and resultant trauma from wiping and scratching.\nAnorectal diseases \u2014 Anorectal diseases associated with anal pruritus include prolapsed internal hemorrhoids, abscesses, fissures, and fistulas (picture 1 and picture 2 and picture 3) [2]. Skin tags do not contribute significantly to anal pruritus [4]. (See \"Hemorrhoids: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis\", section on 'Clinical manifestations' and \"Perianal and perirectal abscess\" and \"Anal fissure: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, prevention\" and \"Anorectal fistula: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis\", section on 'Clinical features'.)\nDermatologic diseases \u2014 Anal pruritus can also result from a variety of inflammatory skin disorders [5].\nTo continue reading this article, you must sign in with your personal, hospital, or group practice subscription.\nSubscribe\nSign in\nDisclaimer: This generalized information is a limited summary of diagnosis, treatment, and/or medication information.

The ileocecal region is a potential site for a variety of NSAID-induced injuries including erosions, ulcers, strictures, perforation, and the formation of diaphragms, which can lead to bowel obstruction [6-9]. NSAIDs can also lead to colitis resembling inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), exacerbate pre-existing IBD, or complicate diverticular disease (ie, perforation or bleeding) [10,11]. Older adults and those on long-term NSAID therapy appear to be at highest risk [11]. There may also be an association between NSAID use and collagenous colitis. (See \"Microscopic (lymphocytic and collagenous) colitis: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management\".)\nSTUDIES OF NSAID INJURY\nA number of studies using different methodologies have evaluated the potential deleterious effects of NSAIDs on the small bowel and colon. Considered together, they suggest that NSAID-related intestinal injury is common. However, the proportion of patients who develop clinically important NSAID-induced enteropathy remains relatively small.\nThe following summarizes the range of findings:\n\u25cf\nApproximately two-thirds of NSAID users demonstrate intestinal inflammation by indirect methods of 111-Indium-labeled leukocyte scintigraphy and 111-Indium fecal excretion [12].\n\u25cf\nIn a case-control study, patients with small or large bowel perforation or bleeding were more than twice as likely to be NSAID users [13].\nTo continue reading this article, you must sign in with your personal, hospital, or group practice subscription.\nSubscribe\nSign in\nDisclaimer: This generalized information is a limited summary of diagnosis, treatment, and/or medication information.

The ducts are opacified by injecting a contrast medium, thereby permitting radiographic visualization and therapeutic interventions. ERCP-guided interventions are used for management of a variety of pancreaticobiliary disorders (eg, removal of bile duct stones, relief of biliary obstruction).\nERCP is a complex procedure that requires specialized training and experience, and it is associated with higher rates of serious complications than other endoscopic procedures (eg, upper endoscopy, colonoscopy). It is important to use strategies to prevent ERCP-related complications and to recognize complications early so that treatment can be initiated.\nThis topic will provide an overview of ERCP including indications, patient preparation, post-procedure care, and complications.\nSpecific ERCP-guided interventions are discussed separately:\n\u25cf\n(See \"Endoscopic stenting for malignant biliary obstruction\".)\nTo continue reading this article, you must sign in with your personal, hospital, or group practice subscription.\nSubscribe\nSign in\nDisclaimer: This generalized information is a limited summary of diagnosis, treatment, and/or medication information.

It can affect both the large and small intestines, is often progressive, and may lead to a variety of clinical consequences depending upon the extent of the injury. It usually develops three or more months after radiation therapy. Chronic radiation enteritis is due to an obliterative arteritis that leads to intestinal ischemia, which can result in stricture, ulceration, fibrosis, and occasionally fistula formation. The physiologic consequences can include altered intestinal transit, reduced bile acid absorption, increased intestinal permeability, bacterial overgrowth, and lactose malabsorption. Clinical manifestations include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss, malnutrition, and bleeding (usually in patients with colonic involvement).\nThis topic review will focus on the diagnosis and management of chronic radiation injury to the small intestine and proximal colon. The pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and risk factors for chronic radiation enteritis and other radiation-related gastrointestinal toxicities are discussed separately. (See \"Overview of gastrointestinal toxicity of radiation therapy\" and \"Radiation proctitis: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management\".)\nDIAGNOSIS\nThe diagnosis of chronic radiation enteritis is suspected in patients with nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or lower gastrointestinal bleeding three or more months after completion of radiation therapy. The diagnosis is usually established by segmental bowel inflammation in regions of a known radiation field on imaging or by endoscopy and histology.\nDiagnostic approach \u2014 Evaluation of a patient with suspected chronic radiation enteritis serves to exclude other causes of etiologies, establish the diagnosis of chronic radiation, and determine the extent of the disease.\n\u25cf\nThe patient's prior radiation treatment should be reviewed to determine the cumulative dose, dose per fraction, proximity of sensitive tissues and organs, and other cancer treatments (eg, abdominal surgery, concurrent chemotherapy) that can increase the risk of radiation enteritis. This may help to determine which intestinal segments may have received excessive radiation exposure, which can then be correlated with the radiologic findings and the clinical presentation.\nTo continue reading this article, you must sign in with your personal, hospital, or group practice subscription.\nSubscribe\nSign in\nDisclaimer: This generalized information is a limited summary of diagnosis, treatment, and/or medication information.
