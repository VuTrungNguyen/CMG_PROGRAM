INTRODUCTION
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is comprised of two major disorders: ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn disease (CD). These disorders have distinct pathologic and clinical characteristics (table 1), but their pathogenesis remains poorly understood. (See "Definitions, epidemiology, and risk factors for inflammatory bowel disease".)
UC disease activity varies substantially among patients, and individual patients may experience variable disease activity over time. Among health care encounters for children with active UC, approximately 5 percent have acute severe colitis [1]. Some of these cases will be the initial manifestation of UC, while others represent exacerbations or "flares" of the chronic disease. The management of these patients is reviewed here. Other aspects of the diagnosis and management of children with UC are discussed in separate topic reviews:
●
(See "Clinical presentation and diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease in children".)
●
(See "Important health maintenance issues for children and adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease".)
●
(See "Management of mild to moderate ulcerative colitis in children and adolescents".)

INTRODUCTION
The number of long-term survivors of colorectal cancer (CRC) has increased as death rates from CRC have declined progressively in the United States and in many other Western countries. CRC survivors are experiencing normal issues of aging, which may be compounded by the long-term effects of prior cancer and cancer therapy. Long-term CRC survivors are at risk for recurrent CRC, a new primary CRC, other cancers, and both short- and long-term treatment toxicity. Additional issues for cancer survivors include psychological, reproductive, genetic, social, and employment concerns.
This topic review will present an approach to the care of the adult survivor of CRC who completes therapy. An overview of cancer survivorship for primary care and oncology providers and post-treatment surveillance after CRC treatment is discussed separately.
●
(See "Overview of cancer survivorship care for primary care and oncology providers".)
●
(See "Post-treatment surveillance for colorectal cancer".)
DEFINITION
For this overview, we define a CRC survivor as an individual who has completed treatment for CRC (ie, surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiation therapy) and has no evidence of disease.

INTRODUCTION
Clostridioides difficile is an important cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and one of the most common health care-associated pathogens [1]. Its clinical manifestations range from asymptomatic colonization or mild diarrhea to fulminant disease characterized by ileus, toxic megacolon, hypotension, or shock. C. difficile infection is less common in children than adults, but the incidence of C. difficile infection in children is increasing [2-5].
The clinical features and diagnosis of C. difficile infection in children will be discussed here. The microbiology, pathogenesis, epidemiology, treatment, and prevention of C. difficile infection in children and C. difficile infection in adults are discussed separately:
●
(See "Clostridioides difficile infection in children: Microbiology, pathogenesis, and epidemiology".)
●
(See "Clostridioides difficile infection in children: Treatment and outcome".)

INTRODUCTION
Pneumatosis intestinalis (PI) refers to the presence of gas within the wall of the small or large intestine. Intramural gas can also affect the stomach, but this condition is referred to as gastric pneumatosis [1]. Since its first description, PI has appeared in the literature under many names, including pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis, intramural gas, pneumatosis coli, pseudolipomatosis, intestinal emphysema, bullous emphysema of the intestine, and lymphopneumatosis [2,3]. PI can also be associated with pneumoperitoneum or free air in the peritoneal cavity.
The pathogenesis of PI is poorly understood and is probably multifactorial. In some cases, PI is an incidental finding associated with a benign etiology, whereas in others, it portends a life-threatening intra-abdominal condition. As a result of the wide array of clinical settings in which PI is encountered, its implications are often misinterpreted. This topic will review the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, evaluation, and management of PI. The clinical features of necrotizing enterocolitis, an important cause of PI in newborns, is discussed in detail separately. (See "Neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis: Clinical features and diagnosis".)
EPIDEMIOLOGY
The incidence of pneumatosis intestinalis (PI) is difficult to ascertain since most patients are asymptomatic and never come to clinical attention [3]. Adults are typically diagnosed in the fifth to eighth decade. (See "Neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis: Clinical features and diagnosis".)
ETIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS
Pneumatosis intestinalis (PI) is idiopathic (15 percent) or secondary (85 percent) to a wide variety of gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal illnesses (table 1) [4,5]. The majority of cases in infants are secondary to necrotizing enterocolitis. (See "Neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis: Clinical features and diagnosis".)  
Numerous hypotheses have been proposed to explain the pathogenesis of PI, including mechanical, bacterial, and biochemical causes. Although the theories are distinctly different, they are not necessarily mutually exclusive. It is likely that multiple pathogenic mechanisms are involved in the formation of PI.

INTRODUCTION
A cecal volvulus is the rotation or torsion of a mobile cecum and ascending colon, which causes approximately 1 to 3 percent of all large bowel obstructions [1-3]. If untreated, cecal volvulus can progress to bowel ischemia, necrosis, or perforation [4-8].
The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of cecal volvulus are discussed here. Other causes of large bowel obstruction are discussed elsewhere. (See "Large bowel obstruction" and "Sigmoid volvulus".)
EPIDEMIOLOGY
Although volvulus can occur at other sites of the alimentary tract, including the stomach, gallbladder, and small bowel, it most commonly occurs in the colon [9]. The cecum (10 to 52 percent) and sigmoid colon (43 to 71 percent) are the two most common sites of colonic volvulus [7,10-14]. Types of gastrointestinal volvuli other than cecal volvulus, such as sigmoid volvulus or gastric volvulus, are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See "Sigmoid volvulus" and "Gastric volvulus in adults".)
Colonic volvulus accounts for approximately 3.4 percent of all cases of bowel obstructions in the United States, but is more common in Africa, the Middle East, and South America [11]. In other studies, the incidence of cecal volvulus ranged from 2.8 to 7.1 per million people per year [4,6].
PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
There are three types of cecal volvulus (figure 1) [4-8]:

INTRODUCTION
Clinicians are frequently asked to make recommendations to patients about travel safety. Air travel exposes people to different factors that could have an impact on their health status. There is limited availability or absence of medical care in the event of medical emergencies [1]. This topic review will present an overview of issues for clinicians to consider when evaluating the risks posed by commercial air travel.
Multiple topics in UpToDate discuss specific aspects of air travel. Related topics include:
●
(See "Jet lag".)

INTRODUCTION
The term "incarcerated gravid uterus" refers to a uterus that is trapped between the sacral promontory and pubic symphysis during pregnancy. This topic will discuss the pathophysiology, risk factors, clinical presentation, diagnosis, complications, and management of this rare condition. The literature about incarcerated gravid uterus consists primarily of single case reports; thus, there is a lack of high-quality evidence to guide management.
PREVALENCE
Incarcerated uterus has been reported to occur in 1 in 3000 to 10,000 pregnancies [1].
PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
The uterus is retroverted (and/or retroflexed) in up to 20 percent of pregnancies [2]. As the uterus enlarges during pregnancy, the retroverted/retroflexed fundus normally rises from the hollow of the sacrum to an anterior ventral position, spontaneously correcting any retroposition. In rare cases, however, the fundus becomes wedged below the sacral promontory, where it continues to enlarge normally for a period of time [3]. The cervix becomes displaced cephalad against or above the symphysis pubis and pushes against the urethra and bladder, which can interfere with normal voiding.
As the pregnancy progresses beyond 20 weeks of gestation, the posterior pelvis becomes too small to allow further fundal enlargement, so the anterior lower uterine wall begins to thin and balloon into the upper abdomen, developing a sacculation to accommodate the products of conception [4]. This is termed "inverted polarity" because the anterior lower uterine wall becomes cephalad to the fundus, which is posterior-caudal. Concomitantly, both the bladder and the cervix are pulled up into the abdominal cavity toward the umbilicus. The cervix can stretch to 10 cm or more in length, such that the internal os becomes located above the symphysis pubis and occasionally above the bladder [5]. Normal and incarcerated anatomy are shown in the figures (figure 1A-B).
RISK FACTORS
Any condition that may inhibit the fundus of the enlarging uterus from ascending out of the sacral hollow is a risk factor for incarceration. The most common of these conditions include [4,6-8]:

INTRODUCTION
For patients with locally advanced rectal cancer without distant metastatic disease, initial management includes some combination of systemic therapy, radiation therapy (RT), and surgical resection (algorithm 1). However, locoregional relapses still occur in 4 to 8 percent of patients who receive appropriate initial treatment for locally advanced rectal cancer [1-3], although distant recurrences still predominate [3-6].
The treatment of locally recurrent rectal cancer is presented here. Other topics related to the management of locally advanced rectal cancer are discussed separately.

INTRODUCTION
In general, testing for cancer among patients with kidney failure occurs in four situations:
●
In patients with clinical evidence of disease, such as rectal bleeding or a palpable breast mass. This is not screening by definition.
●
In asymptomatic patients on maintenance dialysis, to ascertain their suitability for kidney transplantation. (See "Kidney transplantation in adults: Evaluation of the potential kidney transplant recipient".)
●
In asymptomatic patients with a functioning kidney transplant. Transplant recipients require treatment with immunosuppressive medications, which can increase their risk of cancer. This form of screening is discussed elsewhere. (See "Overview of care of the adult kidney transplant recipient", section on 'Screening' and "Malignancy after solid organ transplantation".)
●
In asymptomatic patients on maintenance dialysis, aiming to improve outcomes by identifying disease at an earlier and more treatable stage.

INTRODUCTION
Phosphate is an inorganic molecule consisting of a central phosphorus atom and four oxygen atoms. In the steady state, the serum phosphate concentration is primarily determined by the ability of the kidneys to excrete dietary phosphate. The diagnostic approach to hyperphosphatemia involves elucidating why phosphate entry into the extracellular fluid exceeds the degree to which it can be excreted in order to maintain normal plasma levels.
A broad overview of the causes and treatment of hyperphosphatemia is presented in this topic. Detailed discussions of renal osteodystrophy and the treatment of hyperphosphatemia in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are found elsewhere:

INTRODUCTION
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory condition of the large intestine that is limited to the mucosal layer of the colon. It almost always involves the rectum and may extend in a proximal and continuous fashion to involve other portions of the colon. The pattern of disease activity is characterized by periods of active inflammation alternating with periods of remission.
Most patients with UC are treated with pharmacologic therapy, and multiple drugs are available. Therapies can be grouped as induction therapies (ie, relatively rapid onset of action) and maintenance therapies (ie, appropriate for long-term use). Some therapies (eg, biologic agents, small molecules) are used for both induction and maintenance of remission. While glucocorticoids may be used for inducing remission, they are not effective or suitable for maintaining remission. As a result, the term "maintenance of remission" refers to glucocorticoid-free remission.
The focus of this topic is the medical management of adult patients with moderate to severe UC in an ambulatory setting. The management of patients who require hospitalization for management of severe UC is discussed separately. (See "Management of the hospitalized adult patient with severe ulcerative colitis".)
The surgical management of UC is discussed separately. (See "Surgical management of ulcerative colitis".)
Medical management of adult patients with mild to moderate UC is discussed separately. (See "Medical management of low-risk adult patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis".)

INTRODUCTION
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common disease. The risk of developing CRC is influenced by both environmental and genetic factors.
The epidemiology of CRC and risk factors for its development will be discussed here. Other topics related to colorectal cancer are discussed separately.
●
CRC screening – (See "Screening for colorectal cancer in patients with a family history of colorectal cancer or advanced polyp" and "Tests for screening for colorectal cancer" and "Screening for colorectal cancer: Strategies in patients at average risk".)
●
Clinical presentation and diagnosis of CRC – (See "Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and staging of colorectal cancer" and "Pretreatment local staging evaluation for rectal cancer".)
●
Treatment of CRC – (See "Overview of the management of primary colon cancer" and "Overview of the management of rectal adenocarcinoma".)
EPIDEMIOLOGY
CRC incidence and mortality rates vary markedly around the world. Globally, CRC is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in males and the second in females, according to the World Health Organization GLOBOCAN database [1]. Rates of both incidence and mortality are substantially higher in males than in females.
CRC incidence and mortality have been slowly but steadily decreasing in the United States [2]. Approximately 153,000 new cases of large bowel cancer are diagnosed annually, including about 107,000 cases of colon cancer and over 46,000 cases of rectal cancer [3]. Annually, over 53,000 people die of CRC in the United States.
Incidence — The regional incidence of CRC varies globally. The highest incidence rates are in Australia and New Zealand, Europe, and North America, and the lowest rates are found in Africa and South-Central Asia [4]. These geographic differences appear to be attributable to differences in dietary and environmental exposures, low socioeconomic status, and lower rates of CRC screening that are imposed upon a background of varying susceptibility [5-7].
In the United States, the lifetime incidence of CRC in patients at average risk is approximately 4 percent [8]. CRC incidence is higher in males than in females and in Black Americans than in White Americans [3,9]. The incidence is also higher in patients with specific inherited conditions that predispose them to the development of CRC. (See 'Risk factors' below.)
A gradual shift toward right-sided or proximal colon cancers has been observed both in the United States [10,11] and internationally [12,13] with the greatest relative increase in incidence in cecal primaries. This change in the anatomic distribution of CRCs may be, in part, related to improvements in diagnosis and treatment, and increased screening with removal of adenomatous polyps in the distal colon. Colonoscopy is more effective in preventing left-sided than right-sided CRCs, which could also contribute to a shift in distribution of cancers in the colon. It is likely that part of the difference is due to aspects of quality relating to the colonoscopy (poor right-sided preps, incomplete colonoscopy, anatomic configurations compromising visibility) but the biology may also differ between CRCs of the right and left colon. For example, serrated lesions, which are flatter and more difficult to visualize endoscopically, characteristically carry BRAF V600E mutations, give rise to microsatellite unstable CRCs, and are more common in the right colon. Although all of these issues may contribute to a shift toward right- rather than left-sided cancers, there also appears to be a true increase in the incidence of ascending colon and cecal cancers [13,14]. (See "Molecular genetics of colorectal cancer" and "Overview of colon polyps", section on 'Sessile serrated lesions' and "Tests for screening for colorectal cancer", section on 'Colonoscopy'.)
In the United States, CRC incidence rates had been declining by approximately 2 percent per year, but this rate of decline has slowed to approximately 1.2 percent per year in the period 2014 to 2018 [2]. Incidence rates in most other western countries have been stable or increased slightly during this period. By contrast, CRC incidence rates have rapidly increased in several areas historically at low risk, including Spain, and a number of countries within Eastern Asia and Eastern Europe [15,16].
Mortality — Death rates from CRC have declined progressively since the mid-1980s in the United States and in many other western countries [2,3,17]. This improvement in outcome can be attributed, at least in part, to detection and removal of colonic polyps, detection of CRCs at an earlier stage, and more effective primary and adjuvant treatments. However, at least in the United States, the decline in CRC mortality started well before the widespread implementation of CRC screening and before effective adjuvant therapy became widely used [18]. (See "Adjuvant therapy for resected stage III (node-positive) colon cancer" and "Adjuvant therapy for resected rectal adenocarcinoma in patients not receiving neoadjuvant therapy".)
However, notably, in the United States the declining mortality overall is masking trends in younger adults:
●
In data derived from the SEER Database of the National Cancer Institute, CRC mortality rates per 100,000 population among individuals under age 50 declined by approximately 2 percent per year from 2000 to 2004, and then increased by 1 percent annually through 2018. The increase was limited to White and Hispanic individuals; by contrast among Black individuals and Asian/Pacific Islander individuals, mortality rates were either stable or declined over this same time period [19].
●
Similar trends are reported by the American Cancer Society [3,9], and the National Center for Health Statistics (figure 1) [20].
Globally, the United States has one of the highest survival rates from CRC. Data collected by the SEER Program of the United States National Cancer Institute suggest that nearly 65 percent of all patients treated for CRC (all stages and sites combined) between 2011 and 2017 survive five years [8].
In contrast to these data, mortality rates continue to increase in many countries with more limited resources and health infrastructure, particularly in Central and South America and Eastern Europe, as reflected in data from the international WHO GLOBOCAN database [1].
Increasing incidence of colorectal cancer in the United States with age, SEER 2017 to 2021
Figure 2
Age — Age is a major risk factor for sporadic CRC. CRC is uncommon before the age of 40; the incidence begins to increase significantly between the ages of 40 and 50, and age-specific incidence rates increase in each succeeding decade thereafter (figure 2). Age is a factor that impacts screening recommendations for CRC. (See 'Factors that may influence screening recommendations' below.)
EARLY ONSET COLORECTAL CANCER
Although increasing age is a major risk factor for CRC, there is a global epidemiologic trend towards early onset colorectal cancer (EOCRC), or the diagnosis of CRC in people under the age of 50 years. Efforts to reduce the incidence and mortality of EOCRC include assessing for potential modifiable risk factors, identifying individuals eligible for earlier CRC surveillance, and promoting both clinician and patient awareness of the potential symptoms associated with CRC (eg, persistent rectal bleeding at any age [21]). The impact of some of these factors on CRC screening recommendations are discussed separately. (See 'Factors that may influence screening recommendations' below.)
Incidence — The incidence of CRC is increasing in individuals under the age of 50 years while it is decreasing in older individuals in the United States and Western countries [3,9,22-31]. In the United States, the proportion of new CRC cases among adults under the age of 55 years increased from 11 to 20 percent between 1995 and 2019 [9]. In multiple lower-middle income countries, the ratios of early to late onset CRC are strikingly higher than the international average and in West countries, but this may be partly due to the limited life expectancy of those populations [32]. Some studies also report a rising incidence of CRC even among young adults up to 39 years of age, although the absolute number of cases in this age group remains far lower than for adults aged 50 or over [33-35].
These findings are being driven predominantly by left-sided cancers and rectal cancer [9,27,36,37]. It is also likely that the increased incidence of EOCRC is real and not representative of a shift in age at diagnosis attributable to earlier detection. For instance, among patients diagnosed with CRC under the age of 50 years, a majority (over 86 percent) are symptomatic, and their disease is being diagnosed at later stages [25,38,39].
Risk factors — The reason(s) underlying EOCRC may be multifactorial, with contributions from genetic influences as well as environmental and lifestyle exposures [40]. Possible risk factors for EOCRC include:
●
Hereditary CRC syndromes – In the United States, it is estimated that up to 35 percent of these young adult cancers are associated with the known hereditary CRC syndromes, but the causes for the balance remain unknown [36,37,41-43]. A similar trend has also been observed in lower middle-income countries with lower rates of CRC compared with Western countries [1]. The high proportion of germline variants in these younger individuals emphasizes the importance of referral for genetic counseling and testing [44]. (See 'Hereditary CRC syndromes' below and "Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer): Clinical manifestations and diagnosis", section on 'Indications for germline testing'.)
●
Metabolic dysregulation – Potential risk factors include obesity [45-47], metabolic syndrome [45,48,49], metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease [50], sedentary behavior [45], red meat intake [48], unhealthy dietary patterns [51-53], hypertension [45,48], and hyperlipidemia [45,46,48]. (See 'Obesity' below.)
●
History of CRC in a first-degree relative [45-48]
●
Alcohol consumption (particularly in heavy users) [45-47,53,54]
●
Lack of regular use of NSAIDs [47,53]
●
Vitamin D intake – Increased vitamin D intake may be a protective factor for EOCRC [48,55], although this requires further study. (See 'Vitamin D' below.)
●
Other factors – Limited data suggest other potential risk factors such as alterations in the gastrointestinal microbiome [56,57], ulcerative colitis and other inflammatory bowel diseases [45,49], chronic kidney disease [45], occupational exposure to organic dusts [45], level of educational attainment [53], and socioeconomic status [47].
●
Is EOCRC genomically different from average-onset CRC? – Data are mixed as to whether EOCRC is genomically different from average-onset CRC, and further studies are necessary. In some studies, EOCRC is associated with more advanced age-associated methylomic drift and accelerated aging in the normal mucosa of people with EOCRC; this suggests that drivers to methylation profiles characteristic of CRC are active earlier in EOCRC [58]. However, other studies have failed to find evidence that EOCRC is clinically and genomically distinguishable from average-onset CRC [37].
RISK FACTORS
Although data support the view that some risk factors are more related to colon than to rectal cancer [59], we will consider both entities together.
Environmental and genetic factors can increase the likelihood of developing CRC [60]. Although inherited susceptibility results in the most striking increases in risk, the majority of CRCs are sporadic rather than familial. These risk factors can be separated into those that confer a sufficiently high risk to alter recommendations for CRC screening, factors that may alter screening recommendations, and those that do not alter screening recommendations because they are thought to confer a small or uncertain magnitude of risk.
Factors that influence screening recommendations — CRC screening recommendations are modified for members of families with hereditary colon cancer syndromes, on the basis of personal or family history of CRC or adenomas, in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, and in those who have been exposed to abdominal radiation therapy.
Hereditary CRC syndromes — Several specific genetic disorders, most of which are inherited in an autosomal-dominant fashion, are associated with a very high risk of developing colon cancer. (See "Molecular genetics of colorectal cancer".)
Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer [HNPCC]) are the most common of the familial colon cancer syndromes, but together these two conditions account for only approximately 5 percent of CRC cases, the majority of which are Lynch syndrome [61-64]. (See "Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer): Clinical manifestations and diagnosis" and "Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of familial adenomatous polyposis".)
As many as 12 percent of unselected patients with CRC carry one or more pathogenic mutations in cancer-predisposing genes, and the majority of these are not Lynch syndrome or FAP [64]. In this analysis of 1058 individuals with CRC attending a tertiary American Cancer Center, 105 patients had one or more pathogenic mutations. Seventy-four (7 percent of the total) carried non-Lynch syndrome mutations, which included mutations in high-penetrance genes (APC, biallelic MUTYH, BRCA1 and BRCA2, PALB2, CDKN2A, and TP53), as well as moderate-penetrance genes (monoallelic MUTYH [65], APC allele p.I1307K [66], CHEK2) for which the risk of CRC is not well defined. Broadening the approach, universal genetic testing yielded 6.4 percent more clinically actionable pathogenic germline variants in a series of patients presenting with solid tumors, many of whom had CRC [67]. With the falling costs of genetic testing, the reach of genetic testing is likely to extend further.
An even higher proportion (16 percent) of early onset CRCs (ie, diagnosed prior to age 50) may be associated with an inherited syndrome [68]. Furthermore, one-third of those found to have a potentially pathogenic germline mutation did not meet established genetic testing criteria for the gene in which they had a mutation. These data suggest that genetic counseling and testing with a multigene panel could be considered for all patients with early onset CRC.
Adenomatous polyposis syndromes
FAP — Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and its variants (Gardner syndrome, Turcot syndrome, and attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis [AFAP]) account for less than 1 percent of CRCs. In typical FAP, numerous colonic adenomas appear during childhood. Symptoms appear at an average age of approximately 16 years and colonic cancer occurs in 90 percent of untreated individuals by age 45 (picture 1 and picture 2). AFAP carries a high risk of colon cancer (though its magnitude is not as well defined), but AFAP is characterized by fewer adenomas and an older average age of cancer diagnosis of 54 years. Clinical experience suggests less discrimination between FAP and AFAP, as there can be age-matched individuals with thousands of adenomas as well as those with oligo-polyposis within the same family. (See "Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of familial adenomatous polyposis", section on 'Attenuated FAP'.)
FAP is caused by germline mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene which is located on chromosome 5. The same gene is involved in the attenuated form of FAP, but the sites of the APC gene mutations are different. (See "Molecular genetics of colorectal cancer" and "Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of familial adenomatous polyposis" and "Familial adenomatous polyposis: Screening and management of patients and families".)
An APC gene variant occurring in approximately 6 to 8 percent of the Ashkenazi Jewish population has been associated with a 1.5- to 2-fold increased colon cancer risk without an associated polyposis [66,69]. However, in itself, it does not add risk beyond that of a family history in first-degree relatives and is therefore of limited clinical utility.
MAP — MUTYH-associated polyposis (MAP) is an autosomal-recessive syndrome due to biallelic germline mutations in the base excision repair gene mutY homolog (MUTYH). The phenotype of MAP is variable, but it can present with a polyposis phenotype; typically with fewer than 500 adenomas. The base excision repair system repairs mutations due to oxidative DNA damage, and the APC gene appears to be particularly susceptible to such damage. Thus, failure of the base excision repair system often leads to somatic mutations in APC and KRAS, especially G:C to T:A transversions, which can lead to a polyposis phenotype. An increasing number of reports suggest that germline mutations in these MUTYH genes may account for a substantial fraction of familial CRCs that occur in the absence of a dominantly inherited familial syndrome, and that a significant number of biallelic carriers present with cancer without associated polyposis, making their phenotype very difficult to identify. (See "Molecular genetics of colorectal cancer", section on 'MUTYH defects and familial colorectal cancer' and "MUTYH-associated polyposis".)
Other polyposis genes (POLE and POLD1, MSH3, and NTHL-associated polyposis [NAP]) are also part of next-generation panels with developing experience of their phenotypes. Pathogenic variants in MSH3 and NTHL-associated polyposis are both inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.
Lynch syndrome — Lynch syndrome or HNPCC is an autosomal-dominant syndrome that is more common than FAP and accounts for approximately 3 percent of all colonic adenocarcinomas. Lynch syndrome can be suspected on the basis of a strong family history of CRC, endometrial, and other cancers. (See "Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer): Clinical manifestations and diagnosis", section on 'Colonic manifestations'.)
The name Lynch syndrome honors the pioneering work of Dr. Henry Lynch in drawing attention to the syndrome. The term Lynch syndrome is now commonly reserved for families who have been genetically determined to have a disease-causing defect in one of the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes, most commonly hMLH1, hMSH2, hMSH6, or hPMS2. As a general rule, patients with Lynch syndrome have a germline mutation in one allele of an MMR gene, and the second allele is somatically inactivated in the CRCs by mutation, loss of heterozygosity, or, less commonly, epigenetic silencing by promoter hypermethylation. As a result, Lynch syndrome CRCs have impaired DNA MMR, are hypermutable, and are microsatellite unstable. (See "Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer): Clinical manifestations and diagnosis", section on 'Colonic manifestations'.)
The colorectal tumors that develop in patients with Lynch syndrome are characterized by early age of onset and a predominance of right-sided lesions. The mean age at initial cancer diagnosis is approximately 48 years, with some patients presenting in their 20s. Nearly 70 percent of first lesions arise proximal to the splenic flexure, and approximately 10 percent will have synchronous (simultaneous onset of two or more distinct tumors) or metachronous cancers (non-anastomotic new tumors developing at least six months after the initial diagnosis). The chance of developing metachronous CRC in those who have had a segmental resection is high: in a study of 382 gene carriers, 16 percent at 10 years, rising to 62 percent at 30 years after primary resection [70].
Extracolonic cancers are very common in Lynch syndrome, particularly endometrial carcinoma, which may occur in up to 60 percent of female mutation carriers in some families. Other sites at increased risk of neoplasm formation include the ovary, stomach, small bowel, hepatobiliary system, brain and renal pelvis or ureter, and possibly breast and prostate.
Penetrance estimates for colon and endometrial cancer in carriers of MLH1 or MSH2 mutations were initially thought to be >80 percent, and 40 percent, respectively. However, these early estimates were based on selected families referred for gene testing, which produced biased estimates (upwards). Population-based series suggest that penetrance estimates are approximately one-half of what they were initially thought to be, and indicate that at least for carriers of an MLH1 or MSH2 mutation, the risk is highest in individuals aged 30 to 39, and that much of the risk attributed to this syndrome is over by the mid-50s [71]. Penetrance estimates for MSH6 and PMS2 carriers are even more modest, making identification of families with these genetic mutations more difficult to identify from family history interrogation [72]. MSH6 carriers have a predilection for endometrial cancers. A clinically useful interactive database predicting future risk by gene, sex, age, and organ has been developed [73]. (See "Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer): Clinical manifestations and diagnosis" and "Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer): Cancer screening and management".)
Are patients with HBOC syndrome at risk? — The majority of patients with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) syndrome have mutations in either the breast cancer type 1 or 2 susceptibility gene (BRCA1 and BRCA2). HBOCs attributable to pathogenic variants in BRCA are characterized by an autosomal-dominant pattern of inheritance; markedly increased susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancers, with an especially early onset of breast cancer; and an increased incidence of tumors of other organs, such as the fallopian tubes, prostate, male breast, and pancreas. (See "Cancer risks in BRCA1/2 carriers".)
The biologic relationship between inherited BRCA gene mutations and CRC is unclear. Although some studies derived from a cancer risk clinic and the Breast Cancer Linkage Consortium have reported an approximately twofold increased risk of colon cancer among BRCA1 mutation carriers [74-76], other population-based series have not confirmed such an association [77,78].
Two meta-analyses have come to different conclusions:
●
One meta-analysis of 18 cohort and case-control studies concluded that carriers of BRCA1 have a higher risk for CRC (odds ratio [OR] 1.49, 95% CI 1.14-1.85) [79]. There were no data on the age of onset of the CRCs in this analysis (although two of the included studies did report a higher risk for early onset CRC [76,80]). The study was also criticized for including family members of BRCA carriers with unknown mutation status; when the analysis was restricted to confirmed BRCA1/2 mutation carriers, the risk was no longer statistically significant [81].
●
A second meta-analysis of BRCA mutation carriers (seven cohort, four case-control studies, 14,252 carriers, with 4831 CRCs identified) failed to find an association between BRCA1/2 mutation carriage and a higher risk for CRC (OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.80-1.32) [82]. Adjustment for age did not alter the outcome. Subgroup analysis also showed no significant increased odds of CRC in BRCA1 carriers (OR 1.27, 95% CI 0.91-1.76), or in those with Ashkenazi Jewish heritage (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.63-1.48).
There are no formal guidelines as to whether or not mutation BRCA carriers should initiate CRC screening at an earlier age than is typically recommended. Nevertheless, in our view, there are insufficient data on CRC risk to justify modifying screening guidelines for BRCA carriers. (See "Cancer risks in BRCA1/2 carriers", section on 'Other solid tumors'.)
Personal or family history of sporadic CRCs or adenomatous polyps — Patients with a personal history of CRC or adenomatous polyps of the colon are at risk for the future development of colon cancer. In patients undergoing resection of a single CRC, metachronous primary cancers develop in 1.5 to 3 percent of patients in the first five years postoperatively. (See "Post-treatment surveillance for colorectal cancer".)
A personal history of large (>1 cm) adenomatous polyps and polyps with villous or tubulovillous histology or with high-grade dysplasia also increases the risk of CRC, particularly if there are multiple polyps [83]. The relative risk (RR) ranges from approximately 3.5 to 6.5 in such patients. On the other hand, as a group, patients with one or two small (<1 cm) tubular adenomas with only low-grade dysplasia do not appear to be at substantially increased risk for subsequent CRC [83]. Recommendations are to manage these latter patients as average-risk individuals.
Family history is also an important risk factor even outside of the syndromes with a defined genetic predisposition. Having a single affected first-degree relative (parent, sibling, or child) with CRC increases the risk approximately twofold over that of the general population [84]. Risk is further increased if two first, or one first and one or more first or second-degree relatives on either side of the family have colon cancer, or if a first-degree relative is diagnosed below 50 years of age [85,86].
Patients who have a family member with an adenomatous colonic polyp may also be at increased risk for adenomas or cancer [84,87-90]. Some United States guidelines recommend earlier screening (age 40 years) for people with a family history of adenomas in relatives <60 years old or two first-degree relatives regardless of age [91-93], while others limit the recommendation to relatives of those with advanced adenomas [94]. A series from Hong Kong identifying an elevated risk for advanced adenomas in relatives of patients themselves with advanced adenomas supports screening in this group of relatives [95]. Guidelines in other countries (eg, Canada and Australia) do not recommend screening of relatives with adenomas, apart from the multiple polyposis syndromes [96,97]. (See "Screening for colorectal cancer in patients with a family history of colorectal cancer or advanced polyp", section on 'Family polyp history'.)
In countries where screening is recommended for relatives of adenoma patients, we suggest that patients whose only familial risk factor for CRC is a relative with a history of adenomatous polyp that is not clearly documented as an advanced adenoma (≥1 cm, or high-grade dysplasia or villous elements) be screened as average-risk patients, with screening options presented separately. Individuals who have a first-degree relative with a documented history of advanced adenoma should be screened similarly to those with a family history of CRC. (See "Screening for colorectal cancer: Strategies in patients at average risk", section on 'Choosing a screening test' and "Screening for colorectal cancer in patients with a family history of colorectal cancer or advanced polyp", section on 'Family polyp history'.)
Inflammatory bowel disease
Ulcerative colitis — There is a well-documented association between chronic ulcerative colitis and colonic neoplasia, with the extent, duration, and activity of disease being the primary determinants. Pancolitis confers a 5- to 15-fold increase in risk compared with the expected incidence in the general population, while disease that is limited to the left side of the colon is associated with approximately a threefold RR; in comparison, the risk does not appear to be significantly increased with proctitis or proctosigmoiditis alone [98,99]. There is evidence that some treatments for inflammatory colitis may decrease CRC risk and quiescent disease carries less risk than chronically active disease, justifying a reduction in frequency of surveillance [100]. (See "Medical management of low-risk adult patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis".)
A reasonable estimate of the colon cancer incidence is approximately 0.5 percent per year for subjects with disease duration between 10 and 20 years, then 1 percent per year thereafter. Most reports suggest that the co-occurrence of ulcerative colitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis identifies a subset of patients with an even greater risk. Others have identified the presence of pseudopolyps as an independent risk factor, particularly if large and complex. Strictures should always raise a suspicion of malignancy. (See "Surveillance and management of dysplasia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease", section on 'Ulcerative colitis' and "Primary sclerosing cholangitis: Inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer" and "Overview of colon polyps", section on 'Inflammatory pseudopolyps'.)
The increase in risk of colon cancer begins approximately 8 to 10 years after the initial diagnosis of pancolitis, and at 15 to 20 years for colitis limited to the left colon (image 1). The probability of developing cancer then increases with disease duration and in those with active inflammation; by the fourth decade of disease it reaches as high as 30 percent in patients with pancolitis. (See "Surveillance and management of dysplasia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease", section on 'Extensive colitis'.)
Crohn disease — Although there are much less data, it appears that pancolitis due to Crohn disease is associated with a similar RR of colon malignancy as extensive ulcerative colitis, although the data are less consistent. Recommendations from expert groups vary for Crohn disease where there is less colonic involvement, but most guidelines recommend surveillance when one-third or more of the colonic mucosa is involved. (See "Surveillance and management of dysplasia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease", section on 'Crohn disease'.)
Abdominopelvic radiation — Cancer survivors who received abdominopelvic radiation therapy in childhood or as adults are at significantly increased risk of subsequent gastrointestinal neoplasms, the majority being CRC [101-104].
For adult survivors of pediatric cancer, there is no consensus as to the optimal time to start screening and the optimal interval between screening evaluations. Guidelines from the Children's Oncology Group recommend colonoscopy every five years for survivors of childhood cancer who received abdominal, pelvic, spine, or total-body irradiation, with screening beginning five years after radiation therapy or at age 30 years, whichever occurs later [105]. Screening options include colonoscopy every five years (preferred) or multitarget stool DNA test every three years. Others suggest screening every 10 years from age 40 to 60 years as a more cost-effective strategy [106]. Guidelines from expert groups outside of the United States do not specify the time to the start of the screening strategy either [107-109].
A history of radiation therapy for prostate cancer has been associated with an increased risk of rectal cancer in several database studies [110,111]. The magnitude of risk is approximately similar to that observed in patients with a family history of colonic adenomas. Whether such cancers follow an adenoma to cancer sequence, and whether increased screening in such patients would improve cancer detection rates and outcomes, is unclear. In contrast to adult survivors of childhood cancer, increased surveillance is not recommended in this group.
Cystic fibrosis — Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) have an elevated risk of CRC. In a meta-analysis, the pooled standardized incidence ratio was 10.91, 95% CI 8.42-14.11, and it was two- to fivefold higher following lung transplantation [112]. The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) has developed guidelines for CRC screening for adults with CF. Although risk estimates are provided, the benefits of screening for CRC in these patients, who as a group have substantial comorbidities, are less certain. This subject is discussed in more detail separately. (See "Cystic fibrosis: Overview of gastrointestinal disease", section on 'Gastrointestinal cancer'.)
Factors that may influence screening recommendations
Age — The rising incidence of early onset CRC, particularly among those in the 40 to 49 year old age group, has prompted at least two groups to lower the recommended age of first screening (see 'Early onset colorectal cancer' above):
●
In 2018, the American Cancer Society issued a "qualified" recommendation to begin screening persons at average risk for CRC at age 45 years [113].
●
In 2021, the United States Preventive Services Task Force changed its recommendation to include screening for CRC in adults starting at age 45 [114].
Other expert groups have not yet changed their recommendations [115-117]. Screening for CRC is discussed in detail separately. (See "Screening for colorectal cancer: Strategies in patients at average risk" and "Screening for colorectal cancer in patients with a family history of colorectal cancer or advanced polyp".)
Race and sex — Black Americans, Native Americans, and Alaskan Native individuals have among the highest incidence and mortality rates for CRC of all racial and ethnic groups in the United States [9]. In addition, CRCs occur at a younger age, as there is a higher frequency of CRC under age 50 in these populations [118]. Among Black Americans, there also appears to be a more proximal distribution of both CRCs and adenomas. The reasons for these findings are unclear, but may be related to a higher prevalence of risk factors associated with CRC and lower rates of access to screening among these populations.
Screening strategies do not differ with regard to race. (See "Screening for colorectal cancer: Strategies in patients at average risk".)
CRC mortality is approximately 33 percent higher in males than in females [9]. Both colonic adenomas and CRCs appear to have a more proximal distribution in females [119], particularly in postmenopausal females. None of the major United States organizations recommend that screening be stratified by sex, but some authors have argued that this should be considered [120], or that flexible sigmoidoscopy is an inadequate screening test in females [119].
Acromegaly — Most reports suggest that colonic adenomas and CRC both occur with increased frequency in acromegaly [121,122], particularly in those with uncontrolled disease.
Guidelines from the Acromegaly Consensus Group recommend colonoscopy for early detection and treatment of premalignant colonic polyps at the time of diagnosis [123].
Renal transplantation — Renal transplantation, in association with long-term immunosuppression, has been linked with increased CRC risk [124,125]. In general, cancer rates in kidney transplant recipients are similar to those of non-transplanted individuals 20 to 30 years older [125]. However, many renal transplant recipients have comorbidities that need to play into screening decisions for CRC. (See "Malignancy after solid organ transplantation".)
Risk factors that do not alter screening recommendations — A number of clinical environmental and lifestyle factors are associated with a small and/or uncertain increased risk of CRC. Although many of these associations have been seen consistently in observational studies, the causal relationship of these associations is largely unproven. Patients may be counseled about these associations and encouraged to reduce or avoid such factors for the primary prevention of CRC.
Obesity — Obesity is a risk factor for CRC [126,127]. A systematic review and meta-analysis of data from 13 studies reported that a weight gain between early adulthood and midlife was associated with a modest but significant increase in the risk of CRC (hazard ratio [HR] 1.23, 95% CI 1.14-1.34) [126]. The HR for weight gain between midlife and older adulthood was lower, but still statistically significant (HR 1.15, 95% CI 1.08-1.24). The risk was highest for those in the highest weight gain category. Obesity also appears to increase the likelihood of dying from CRC. (See "The roles of diet, physical activity, and body weight in cancer survivors" and "Overweight and obesity in adults: Health consequences", section on 'Cancer' and "Adjunctive therapy for patients with resected early stage colorectal cancer: Diet, exercise, NSAIDs, and vitamin D", section on 'Diet and exercise'.)
The excess risk associated with obesity is reduced after bariatric surgery, with at least one report suggesting that CRC rates approximate those in the general population within five or six years of surgery [128,129]. (See "Bariatric surgery for management of obesity: Indications and preoperative preparation" and "Outcomes of bariatric surgery".)
Diabetes mellitus and insulin resistance — Diabetes mellitus is associated with an elevated risk of CRC [130-140]. A meta-analysis of 14 studies (6 case-control and 8 cohort) estimated that the risk of colon cancer among diabetics was approximately 38 percent higher than nondiabetics (RR 1.38, 95% CI 1.26-1.51), and for rectal cancer it was 20 percent higher (RR 1.20, 95% CI 1.09-1.31) [137]. The associations remained when the analysis was limited to studies that controlled for smoking, obesity, and physical activity. This level of increased risk is insufficient to influence surveillance recommendations based upon other factors such as age.
One possible explanation linking diabetes to CRC is hyperinsulinemia, because insulin is an important growth factor for colonic mucosal cells and stimulates colonic tumor cells [141-143]. Plasma concentrations of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and IGF binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) were reported to influence the risk of CRC in a cohort of 14,916 males who were followed prospectively [144]. Subjects with values of IGF-1 in the highest quintiles were more likely to develop CRC compared with those with values in the lowest quintiles (RR 2.51).
In addition to increasing risk of the disease, diabetes may also influence prognosis among patients with CRC [145,146]. As an example, in one cohort study of patients with non-metastatic CRC who were enrolled in the Cancer Prevention Study-II Nutrition Cohort, individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus had a significantly higher risk of cancer-specific mortality relative to those without diabetes [145]. The association was not related to insulin levels as use of insulin did not influence CRC mortality.
Red and processed meat — Although the data are not entirely consistent, long-term consumption of red meat or processed meats appears to be associated with an increased risk of CRC, particularly for left-sided tumors [147-151]. High temperature cooking (eg, barbecuing, pan-frying) has been implicated as contributing to risk, perhaps by the production of polyaromatic hydrocarbons and other carcinogens produced from proteins in the charring process. Lean red meat may be associated with less risk [152].
In 2015, the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) reviewed the evidence linking intake of red and processed meat with CRC; they classified consumption of processed meat as carcinogenic to humans and consumption of red meat as probably carcinogenic [153]; this position was reiterated in its 2020 report [154]. In 2018, the World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research (WCRF/AICR) similarly concluded that the evidence was convincing that consumption of processed meat increases risk of CRC, whereas the evidence for consumption of unprocessed red meat was classified as probable. It is estimated that for every 50 grams of processed meat consumed per day, the risk of CRC increases by approximately 16 percent, and for every 100 grams of red meat consumed per day, it increases by approximately 12 percent [154]. For colon cancer, these estimates were 23 and 22 percent, respectively.
Based upon the amount of data and the consistent association of CRC with processed meats across studies in different populations, which make chance, bias, and confounding unlikely as explanations, the IARC concluded that there was sufficient evidence in human beings to classify processed meats (eg, sausages, bacon, ham, beef jerky, corned beef, and other smoked, salted, fermented, or cured meats) as group 1 carcinogens, placing these foods in the same risk category for cancer as asbestos, cigarettes, and alcohol (although the amount of increased risk is nowhere near the same) [153,154].
Chance, bias, and confounding could not be ruled out with the same degree of confidence for the data on red meat consumption, since no clear association was seen in several high-quality studies, and residual confounding from other diet and lifestyle factors was difficult to exclude. Nevertheless, the working group concluded that there is limited evidence in human beings for the carcinogenicity of consuming red meat (ie, beef, pork, lamb, veal, mutton, horse, goat) and classified these foods as group 2A carcinogens (probably associated). Other dietary guidelines also support limiting consumption of red and processed meat [155].
However, these conclusions are based entirely on observational studies. It is important to note that data from at least two randomized trials are not consistent with the hypothesis that red and/or processed meat consumption increases the risk of colorectal neoplasia [156]. As an example, the Women's Health Initiative, which involved almost 50,000 females, was unable to show that a reduction in dietary fat, including animal fat, reduced risk of CRC after more than eight years of follow-up [157]. (See "Dietary fat", section on 'Cancer'.)
Furthermore, at least some data suggest that the association between consumption of processed meat and risk of CRC may be modified by inherited susceptibility [158].
In 2019, dietary recommendations proposed by the Nutritional Recommendations Consortium (NutriRECS) indicated that prior recommendations that adults reduce their current red and processed meat consumption to reduce their risk of CRC were not supported by their analysis [159]. Their recommendation was based on four meta-analyses showing low-certainty evidence of the very small adverse health effects of red and processed meat consumption [160-163] and a systematic review evaluating consumer values and preferences [164]. It is unclear where these recommendations should fit in relation to those of other groups that support limiting consumption of red and processed meats [153,155]. While the findings of their meta-analyses were actually similar to others', their use of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system, which classifies all observational data as low-quality evidence, remains a point of contention.
Overall, although there may be an increased risk of developing CRC associated with intake of processed meats, the absolute risk is small and only occurs with daily consumption, and it is not clear that all individuals have the same risk. In our view, modest consumption of red and/or processed meat (one to two times weekly at most) is an acceptable part of a healthy, balanced diet. (See "Healthy diet in adults".)
Tobacco — Cigarette smoking has been associated with increased incidence and mortality from CRC. A meta-analysis of 106 observational studies estimated that the risk of developing CRC was increased among cigarette smokers compared with those who never smoked (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.11-1.25) [165]. The risk of dying from CRC was also increased among smokers (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.14-1.37). For both incidence and mortality, the association was stronger for cancer of the rectum than the colon.
Cigarette smoking is also a risk factor for essentially all types of colonic polyps. For adenomatous polyps, the risk is particularly high for more advanced adenomas (ie, larger and with severely dysplastic features) [166]. Smoking is also a risk factor for serrated polyps of the colon, including those that are hyperplastic and those that are with dysplasia [167,168]. In addition, smoking may increase the risk of CRC in patients with Lynch syndrome (HNPCC) [169].
For these and a host of other reasons, smoking should be avoided, especially by CRC survivors. (See "Approach to the care of colorectal cancer survivors", section on 'Alcohol and tobacco use'.)
Alcohol — An association between alcohol consumption and an increased risk of CRC has been observed in several studies. A meta-analysis of 27 cohort and 34 case-control studies concluded that, compared with never drinkers, there was a significant increase in risk of CRC for moderate (two to three drinks per day, summary RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.13-1.28) and heavy drinkers (≥4 drinks per day, RR 1.52, 95% CI 1.27-1.81), but not light drinkers (≤1 drink per day, RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.95-1.05) [170]. These results are consistent with other pooled analyses [171-173]. However, in contrast to prior studies, a dose-response analysis found a significant 7 percent increase in risk of CRC even in light drinkers (RR for ingestion of 10 g/day of ethanol 1.07 [95% CI 1.04-1.10]). The elevated risk may be related to interference of folate absorption by alcohol and decreased folate intake [174,175]. (See "Overview of the risks and benefits of alcohol consumption".)
Excessive alcohol consumption is an established, potentially modifiable risk factor for several other malignancies in addition to CRC [154,176], and it also complicates treatment and treatment outcomes by contributing to longer hospitalizations, prolonged recovery, higher health care costs, and greater overall and cancer-related mortality. The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) has issued a statement on the association of alcohol consumption with multiple cancers, which outlines proposals for promoting awareness of the association between alcohol abuse and certain types of cancer, supporting policy efforts to reduce the risk of cancer through evidence-based strategies that prevent excessive use of alcohol, and providing education to oncology providers about the influence of excessive alcohol use on cancer risk and treatment complications [177].
Use of androgen deprivation therapy — A review of 107,859 males aged 67 and older with prostate cancer who were included in the linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Reporting (SEER)/Medicare database suggests that long-term androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) may also increase the risk of CRC [178]. Males who received treatment with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or orchidectomy had a higher risk of developing CRC, and the risk increased with longer duration of ADT. Compared with no ADT, the HR for CRC associated with a GnRH agonist for 25 months or longer was 1.31 (95% CI 1.12 to 1.53), and for orchidectomy it was 1.37 (95% CI 1.14-1.66). The mechanism(s) underlying this putative association are unclear, but insulin resistance as a consequence of ADT has been suggested as a possible contributor [179]. These risk estimates fall below those qualifying for special attention in most screening guidelines.
Cholecystectomy — A relationship between cholecystectomy and right-sided colon cancer has been described in some reports. As an example, in a study of 278,460 patients followed for up to 33 years after surgery, patients who had undergone cholecystectomy had a slightly increased risk of right-sided colon cancer (standardized incidence ratio 1.16), but not more distal colon cancers [180]. Several meta-analyses have confirmed this association with proximal colon cancers [181,182], although discordant data have also been reported [183,184]. The mechanism is thought to be related to alterations in bile acid composition in the colon after cholecystectomy [185-187].
Other risk factors — Several other risk factors have been studied:
●
Coronary artery disease – The presence of coronary artery disease has been associated with an increased risk of CRC and advanced adenomas [188]. The mechanisms underlying the association are unclear but may be related to shared risk factors.
●
Ureterocolic anastomoses for bladder surgery – Ureterocolic anastomoses after extensive bladder surgery are associated with an increased risk of neoplasia in close proximity to the ureteric stoma [189]. (See "Urinary diversion and reconstruction following cystectomy", section on 'Ileal conduits'.)
●
Endometrial cancer – A cohort study from the Manitoba Cancer Registry suggests that young females (50 years or younger) with endometrial cancer are at a four- to fivefold higher chance of developing CRC (particularly right-sided tumors) than the general population [190]. Although previous studies of this question have been inconsistent and this study did not address the contribution of Lynch syndrome to their analyses, it does suggest that females with young-onset endometrial cancer should be screened for Lynch syndrome and considered for colonoscopic screening at or around the time of diagnosis of endometrial cancer. (See "Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer): Cancer screening and management".)
●
Gastrointestinal microbiome – Several bacterial and viral agents (eg, Streptococcus bovis, Helicobacter pylori, JC virus, human papilloma virus [HPV], Fusobacterium nucleatum, colonization of the gut by pathogenic strains of E. coli with associated production of colibactin, a DNA-damaging metabolite, and decreased diversity of the gut bacterial microbiome) have been proposed as risk factors for CRC [191-202]. Some data suggest a potential role for intestinal microbiota in mediating the association between diet and colorectal neoplasia [203]. (See 'Fiber' below.)
In support of the possibility that alterations in the gut microbiome influence risk, at least some data suggest an association between antibiotic use and colorectal neoplasia, although causality remains uncertain [204,205]. One of the ways in which the gut microbiome might influence colorectal neoplasia is through altering the bioavailability of aspirin [206]. (See 'Aspirin and NSAIDs' below.)
An association between H. pylori infection and colorectal polyps and CRC has been described but remains controversial [191,207]. The data linking JC virus infection to CRC have been mixed and inconclusive [191]. The association between infection with S. bovis, particularly the S. gallolyticus subtype [208], and colonic neoplasia is well described, but it is thought to be a consequence of, rather than a risk factor for, colonic neoplasia and is discussed separately. (See "Association between Helicobacter pylori infection and gastrointestinal malignancy", section on 'Colon cancer' and "Infections due to Streptococcus bovis/Streptococcus equinus complex (SBSEC; formerly group D streptococci)" and "Infections due to Streptococcus bovis/Streptococcus equinus complex (SBSEC; formerly group D streptococci)", section on 'Association with colonic neoplasia'.)
●
Prolonged sitting – Several (but not all [209]) studies suggest that prolonged sitting, independent of physical inactivity and obesity, increases the risk of CRC, particularly early onset CRC [210-212]. (See 'Early onset colorectal cancer' above.)
PROTECTIVE FACTORS
A number of factors have been reported by at least some studies to be associated with a decreased risk of CRC [213]. These include regular physical activity, a variety of dietary factors, the regular use of aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and hormone replacement therapy in postmenopausal females. None of these factors is used to stratify CRC screening recommendations.
Physical activity — Substantial observational data and several systematic reviews have concluded that regular physical activity, either occupational or leisure time, is associated with protection from CRC [214-219]. In a meta-analysis of 21 studies, there was a significant 27 percent reduced risk of proximal colon cancer when comparing the most versus the least active individuals (relative risk [RR] 0.73, 95% CI 0.66-0.81) [215] and a 26 percent reduction for distal colon cancer (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.68-0.80). The mechanism underlying the apparent protective association of physical activity is not known and no intervention trials of physical activity for CRC prevention have been reported. (See "The benefits and risks of aerobic exercise", section on 'Cancer prevention and treatment'.)
Diet — Many epidemiologic studies have shown an association between the intake of a diet high in fruits and vegetables and protection from CRC [220-222]. The RR of CRC is approximately 0.5 comparing groups with the highest intake to those with the lowest [222]. However, discordant data have also been published. The link between consumption of produce and CRC was challenged in a prospective cohort study that combined subjects from the Nurses' Health Study (88,764 females) and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (47,325 men) [223]. In that analysis, there was no significant association between the consumption of fruits, vegetables, or the combination on the incidence of either colon or rectal cancer, independent of vitamin supplement use or smoking habits.
A pooled analysis of fourteen cohort studies, including the previous study, concluded that eating more than 800 g fruit and vegetables daily, compared with less than 200 g, decreased risk for distal (RR 0.74) but not for proximal colon cancer [224]. On the other hand, a later meta-analysis of 19 cohort studies concluded that there was a weak protective effect of fruit and vegetable intake for highest versus lowest intake of fruits and vegetables (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.86-0.99) and that the inverse association appeared limited to distal colon cancers [225]. Most of the risk reduction was attributable to increasing intake above a threshold value of 100 g/day, with relatively little benefit associated with higher levels of intake. As a reference, a typical apple weighs >200 g. These data suggest that there might be little benefit to increasing the consumption of fruits and vegetables beyond the levels associated with eating a reasonable balanced diet.
Compared with non-vegetarians, vegetarian dietary patterns have also been associated with a significantly reduced risk of CRC, with the effect being most pronounced among pesco-vegetarians [226,227].
Fiber — A number of laboratory, nutritional, and epidemiologic studies have identified a role for dietary fiber in the pathogenesis of CRC [228]. However, the degree to which dietary fiber protects against the development of adenomas or CRC is uncertain since the results of epidemiologic studies, randomized trials, and meta-analyses of prospective observational studies are discordant:
●
A decreased risk of colonic adenomas and CRC with higher intake of fiber was reported in many epidemiologic studies [229-233].
●
On the other hand, in an analysis from the combined Nurses' Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study, no relationship was noted between total dietary fiber intake and risk of CRC [234]. Similarly, the Women's Health Initiative Trial found no protective effect of a modest low-fat, increased fiber, and increased fruit and vegetable dietary intervention on CRC incidence [157].
●
A pooled analysis of 13 prospective cohort studies (involving 725,628 males and females followed for 6 to 20 years) found that dietary fiber intake was inversely associated with the risk of CRC, but the association was no longer apparent after accounting for other dietary risk factors [235].
●
A meta-analysis funded by the World Cancer Research Fund found that for every 10 g/day increase in dietary fiber consumption, there was a significant reduction in the risk of CRC by 10 percent [236,237]. There was a difference between different food groups. While fiber from grains was associated with protection from CRC, fruit, vegetable and legume-based fiber was not. This conclusion was partially supported by a later case-control study nested within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and nutrition (EPIC) study, which found that high consumption of whole grains was associated with a lower rate of distal colon cancer development, but there was no association with overall CRC risk [238].
●
In two randomized controlled studies from the United States as well as one from Australia, fiber supplementation had no significant protective effect for the development of total colorectal adenomas [152,239,240].
●
A systematic review of five studies involving a total of 4349 patients concluded that there was no definitive evidence that increased dietary fiber reduces the incidence or recurrence of adenomatous polyps within a two- to four-year period [241].
While multiple potential explanations may account for the differences among studies [232,242], the type of fiber may be one important factor, as was found in the World Cancer Research Fund meta-analysis. In addition to this analysis, the Australian trial described above, which showed a significant reduction in advanced adenomas (only), used unprocessed wheat bran, which may be more effective in delivering the benefits of cereal fiber as compared with more processed forms [152]. Ultimately, the degree of protection from dietary fiber, if any, will likely remain unsettled in the absence of prospective intervention studies.
One intriguing study suggests an interaction between intestinal microbiota (particularly Fusobacterium nucleatum) and dietary intake of fiber in mediating the risk of colorectal neoplasia [203]. Bacteria like F. nucleatum appear to play a role in stimulating colorectal carcinogenesis, possibly through suppression of the host's immune response to the tumor [198,243]. (See 'Other risk factors' above.)
In this prospective cohort study using data from the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, a total of 1019 incident colon and rectal cancer cases with available F. nucleatum data (using quantitative polymerase chain reaction) were documented over 26 to 32 years of follow-up [203]. Prudent diets rich in whole grains and dietary fiber were associated with a significantly lower risk for F. nucleatum-positive but not F. nucleatum-negative CRCs.
Resistant starch — Resistant starch refers to those forms of starch which escape digestion in the small bowel and pass to the colon, where they are fermented with the production of short-chain fatty acids. Butyrate, one of these fatty acids, has antineoplastic properties in the colon [244]. While this led to initial enthusiasm as to the potential of resistant starch as a chemopreventive agent, a randomized trial of resistant starch (Novelose, 30 g daily) failed to show a beneficial impact on adenoma or cancer development in individuals with Lynch syndrome. [245,246]. However, in long-term follow-up of this trial, resistant starch did provide a delayed protective effect on all non-colorectal Lynch syndrome cancers, especially those in the upper gastrointestinal tract [247]. Additional trials of other forms of resistant starch that are capable of delivering higher levels of butyrate to the colon are in progress.
Folic acid and folate — Folate is the natural form of the vitamin occurring in food, and folic acid is the synthetic form used in food fortification and supplements. Based upon biochemical pathways, the two may not be equivalent and have different in vitro effects.
Data from animal and human studies have demonstrated that folate inhibits pathogenesis of cancer in a number of tissues including the colon [248]. However, whether folate and folic acid have a role in prevention of CRC is unclear. By contrast, the possibility that folic acid supplementation increases the risk of colon cancer has also been raised. The following represents the available data on folate and CRC risk:
●
A combined analysis of data from two cohorts from the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study provide observational evidence in support of a protective effect from folic acid supplementation [249]. There was an association between total folate intake 12 to 16 years before diagnosis and a lower risk of CRC (RR 0.69; 95% CI 0.51-0.94 for ≥800 compared with <250 micrograms of folate per day), but no association with more recent intake. By contrast, both long- and short-term intake of total folate was associated with a lower risk of colorectal adenomas, with a strong association with intake four to eight years before diagnosis (OR 0.68; 95% CI 0.60-0.78 for ≥800 compared with <250 micrograms of folate per day). These observational data suggest that folic acid supplementation could be beneficial in the pre-adenoma stage but not beyond.
●
In contrast to these data, at least two controlled trials involving patients with colonic adenomas found that folic acid supplementation did not reduce the risk of recurrent adenomas [250,251]. Furthermore, in one of the trials, supplementation was associated with an increased risk of having three or more adenomas and of non-CRCs, raising the possibility that folic acid supplementation in adults could be detrimental rather than beneficial for adenoma formation, particularly in those who already have a propensity to form colonic neoplasms [250,252]. An increased risk of colorectal neoplasia from folic acid supplementation or in patients with high plasma levels of unmetabolized folic acid (which accumulates if the body's capacity to reduce folic acid is exceeded) has not been confirmed by others [225,253,254].
Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) — The available data suggest a modest association between higher vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) intake and decreased CRC risk. In a meta-analysis of prospective studies, the pooled RRs of CRC for the highest versus lowest categories of vitamin B6 intake and of blood levels of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (the active form of vitamin B6) were 0.90 (95% CI 0.75-1.07) and 0.52 (95% CI 0.38-0.71), respectively [255]. Omitting one study that contributed substantially to heterogeneity in the studies of vitamin B6 intake, the protective effect of highest versus lowest vitamin B6 intake on CRC risk was statistically significant (pooled RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.69-0.92).
Calcium and dairy products — Another possible protective factor is increased intake of dietary or supplemental calcium [256-263].
At least three controlled trials have evaluated the efficacy of calcium supplementation in prevention of recurrence of colorectal adenomas. A meta-analysis of these data (including a total of 1485 subjects) concluded that the risk of recurrence was significantly lower in patients randomized to calcium (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.68-0.93) [264].
Despite these benefits in adenoma prevention trials, whether calcium supplementation reduces the risk of CRC is unproven. The following data are available:
●
A protective effect of higher calcium intake on the risk of CRC was suggested in an analysis of combined data from the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study [265]. Calcium intake was assessed every four years. Total calcium intake (≥1400 versus <600 mg/day) was associated with a statistically significant lower risk of colon cancer (multivariable RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.65-0.95).
●
On the other hand, a controlled trial of 36,282 postmenopausal females who were randomly assigned to the combination of calcium (1000 mg daily) plus vitamin D3 (400 units daily) or placebo showed no significant difference in the rate of invasive CRC during a mean follow-up of seven years [266]. Questions have been raised as to whether the doses of calcium and vitamin D3 that were used in the trial were sufficient to prevent colon cancer.
However, a subsequent trial of 2303 older females who were assigned to placebo or higher doses of calcium (1500 mg daily) and vitamin D3 (2000 international units daily) also failed to confirm a lower risk of invasive or in situ CRC in the supplemented group over four years [267].
●
Finally, a post hoc analysis of a randomized controlled trial of calcium and vitamin D reported an increased risk of serrated polyps in those randomized to calcium (adjusted RR 2.65, 95% CI 1.43-4.91) and calcium plus vitamin D (RR 3.81, 95% CI 1.25-11.64) [268].
The protective effect of calcium on conventional adenomas may depend upon an individual's genotype for the vitamin D receptor [261] and/or on having normal levels of vitamin D [269].
Calcium supplementation has been recommended for the primary or secondary prevention of colonic adenomas by the American College of Gastroenterology [259]. (See "Overview of colon polyps".)
Epidemiologic studies of dairy products and CRC risk have provided mixed results, with some studies reporting inverse associations between intake of total dairy products, milk, and/or yogurt and CRC risk, and others finding no association. Dairy products have been hypothesized to protect against CRC because of their high calcium content; however, some dairy products, such as cheese and cream, have a high fat content, which may counterbalance the protective effect, possibly by affecting the bile acid composition in the colon. (See 'Cholecystectomy' above.)
A meta-analysis of 19 cohort studies concluded that diets with higher milk and total dairy product intake were associated with a significant, but modest, reduction in CRC risk (summary RR for milk 0.82, 95% CI 0.74-0.93) [270]. The protective effect was restricted to colon and not rectal cancer. There was no association between intake of cheese or other dairy products (including low-fat dairy products) and CRC risk.
Vitamin D — Vitamin D and its metabolites act as inhibitors of CRC progression in model systems by effects that influence both initiation and progression [271]. An analysis by the World Health Organization identified colon cancer as the type of cancer with the greatest risk associated with poor vitamin D status [272].
Observational studies also suggest an association between low vitamin D levels and the risk of many cancers, including CRC [273,274]. This association was demonstrated in a pooled analysis of 5706 patients with CRC and 7107 control patients with a range of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels [274]. Compared with 25(OH)D levels of 20 to <25 ng/mL, lower levels of 25(OH)D (<12 ng/mL) were associated with a higher risk of CRC (RR 1.31, 95% CI 1.05-1.62). In contrast, higher levels of 25(OH)D (≥30 ng/mL) were associated with a lower risk of CRC (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.67-0.99 for levels of 30 to <35 ng/mL; RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.59-0.91 for levels of 35 to <40 ng/mL, respectively). These vitamin D levels (30 to 40 ng/mL [75 to 100 nmol/L]) are within the accepted range for optimizing skeletal health. (See "Vitamin D deficiency in adults: Definition, clinical manifestations, and treatment", section on 'Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D'.)
There are two caveats:
●
It is not clear if these observed associations are causal as the current interventional data on the protective effect of vitamin D supplementation on the development of colorectal neoplasia are conflicting.
●
Whether the elevated CRC risk seen with vitamin D deficient states can be overcome through supplementation is not known. At least one randomized placebo-controlled trial has concluded that vitamin D supplementation for five years did not result in a lower incidence of any invasive cancer, including CRC [275].
This subject is addressed in detail separately. (See "Vitamin D and extraskeletal health", section on 'Cancer'.)
In addition to these data, there are also some data suggesting an association between poor vitamin D status and mortality in patients with CRC, both in the setting of advanced metastatic disease and resected potentially curable disease. (See "Adjunctive therapy for patients with resected early stage colorectal cancer: Diet, exercise, NSAIDs, and vitamin D", section on 'Vitamin D status' and "Initial systemic therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer", section on 'What is the role of vitamin D?'.)
Magnesium — Animal studies suggest that dietary magnesium may influence CRC development. A population-based study from Sweden found an inverse association between magnesium intake and the risk of CRC in females [276]. Compared with females in the lowest quintile of magnesium intake, the risk was reduced by approximately 40 percent (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.40-0.87) in females with the highest quintile of intake. The inverse association was observed for both colon and rectal cancer.
Garlic — Consumption of garlic has been associated with a reduced risk of colonic adenomas in some observational studies of patients with CRC and in laboratory studies [277,278]. Garlic has been included as a probable protective factor by the World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute of Cancer Research [237] but a review by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) concluded that there was "very limited credible evidence for a relation between garlic consumption and reduced colon cancer risk." Additional prospective intervention studies are needed to settle this issue.
Fish consumption — Consumption of omega 3 fatty acids (mainly as fish oil) has been associated with a reduced incidence of colorectal neoplasia in some observational studies, but the data are conflicting:
●
A meta-analysis of 22 prospective cohort and 19 case-control studies found an overall lower incidence of CRC among individuals with the highest compared with the lowest fish consumption (summary odds ratio [OR] 0.88, 95% CI 0.80-0.95 ) [279].
●
Two grams daily of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) as its free fatty acid has been shown in a randomized controlled trial to reduce the numbers of adenomas by a net change of 22.4 percent compared with placebo, as well as to improve the global polyp burden, in familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) [280].
●
On the other hand, in an analysis of data from the placebo-controlled, randomized VITAL (Vitamin D and Omega 3) trial, supplementation with marine omega 3 fatty acids (1 g/day) did not significantly reduce the risk of CRC precursors in the general population [281].
Coffee intake — Observational studies have found conflicting evidence on the relationship between coffee consumption and risk of CRC. A link between high rates of coffee consumption and a reduced risk of CRC was reported in a meta-analysis of 12 case-control studies [282] and in three other analyses, one from the National Institutes of Health (NIH)-AARP Diet and Health Study [283], another from the population-based Molecular Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer (MECC) study [284], and a third from Japan [285]. However, data from the Nurses' Health Study, the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, a meta-analysis of 12 prospective cohort studies, and a pooled analysis of data from 13 prospective cohort studies do not support this finding [286-288].
Drugs — Several drugs have been shown to have modest to moderate chemopreventive effects in average- and high-risk populations.
Aspirin and NSAIDs — Aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may protect against the development of colonic adenomas and is associated with a decreased long-term risk of colorectal cancer. Further details are discussed separately. (See "NSAIDs (including aspirin): Role in prevention of colorectal cancer" and "Aspirin in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer", section on 'Colorectal cancer'.)
Sulindac plus DFMO or erlotinib — Chemoprevention with the combination of difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) and sulindac (a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug) has been evaluated in one randomized controlled trial [289]. DFMO is an enzyme-activated irreversible inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase, the first, and rate-limiting, enzyme in polyamine synthesis. It was initially developed as a chemotherapy agent because of its cytostatic effects on a variety of cell lines.
In the trial, 375 patients with a history of a resected colonic adenoma were randomly assigned to the combination of sulindac plus DFMO or placebo for three years. The trial was halted after an interim analysis found marked significant reductions in the rate of recurrent adenomas (12 versus 41 percent, RR 0.30), advanced adenomas (0.7 versus 8.5 percent, RR 0.09), and multiple adenomas (0.7 versus 13.2 percent, RR 0.06). Active therapy was associated with a higher rate of mild, subclinical adverse changes in the audiogram (18.4 versus 9.8 percent), which improved in some patients after drug discontinuation. Trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of this regimen have been started in FAP and in patients after treatment for early stage CRC.
Erlotinib, an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor, has also been evaluated in combination with sulindac in patients with FAP. In a randomized placebo-controlled trial, the use of sulindac plus erlotinib for six months resulted in a significantly lower duodenal polyp burden after six months as compared with placebo [290]. However, the utility of this combination is limited by side effects and cost, especially in populations that are not high risk [291]. (See "Familial adenomatous polyposis: Screening and management of patients and families", section on 'Chemoprevention'.)
Hormone therapy in females — Postmenopausal hormone therapy (both combined estrogen plus progestin and unopposed estrogen) has been linked to a reduced risk of CRC [292-300], although the data are more consistent for use of combined (plus progesterone) rather than for unopposed estrogen [292,301]. As an example, a reduction in CRC risk was noted in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) in females taking combined estrogen plus progestin hormone therapy (HR 0.56) [302]. This protective effect remained even after females who reported having screening sigmoidoscopy were excluded. No significant difference in the risk of CRC compared with placebo (HR 1.08) was noted in the unopposed conjugated equine estrogen arm in the WHI [292]. An important finding was that although females receiving combined estrogen and progestin had a lower diagnosis rate of CRC than did the control group, the tumors that did occur in this group were found at a more advanced stage than those found in the control group.
Longer-term follow-up of the WHI data confirmed that the CRCs diagnosed in females receiving combined hormonal therapy were more advanced at diagnosis (regional or distant metastases in 69 versus 51 percent), and were associated with a nonstatistically significant higher mortality rate (37 versus 27 deaths, 0.04 versus 0.03 percent, HR for death 1.29, 95% CI 0.78-2.11) [303]. These data suggest the puzzling possibility that HRT may decrease CRC incidence but not mortality. Such a paradox could be explained by a systematic diagnostic delay in females receiving combined estrogen and progestin postmenopausal hormone therapy or could suggest that HRT actually affects the biology of CRC.
Even prior to the data cited above [303], postmenopausal hormone therapy was not recommended for chemoprevention of colon cancer in females because of the associated long-term risks of therapy. (See "Menopausal hormone therapy: Benefits and risks", section on 'Colorectal cancer'.)
In addition to these data, a protective effect of oral contraceptives in premenopausal females was shown in the Royal College of General Practitioners' Oral Contraception Study [304]. In this study, 46,022 females were recruited in 1968 and 1969 and were observed for up to 44 years. Compared with females who never took them, "ever use" of oral contraceptives was associated with a significantly reduced incidence of CRC (incidence rate ratio 0.81, 95% CI 0.66-0.99).
Statins — Some observational data suggest that statins are associated with a protective effect against several cancers, including colon cancer, but overall, the data are conflicting.
The data regarding CRC are as follows:
●
A modest reduction in the incidence of colon cancer, as a secondary endpoint, was observed in two clinical trials evaluating the benefit of pravastatin and simvastatin for coronary artery disease [305,306].
●
A reduced risk of CRC was also observed in the MECC study, a population-based case-control study in which data regarding personal and family history of cancer, medical conditions, medication use, physical activity, and nutrition were collected from 1953 patients diagnosed with CRC and 2015 population-based controls matched for age, sex, and ethnicity [307]. In this study, use of statins for at least five years was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of CRC (odds ratio [OR] 0.53, 95% CI 0.38-0.74) after adjustment for use of aspirin and other NSAIDs, physical activity, hypercholesterolemia, vegetable consumption, and family history. A potential confounding factor is that the cancer population and the controls were drawn from two different databases.
●
Other case-control studies have failed to document a protective benefit of statin use against colon cancer [308-311].
The explanation for these conflicting results is unclear.
Antioxidants — Several interventional trials have evaluated the efficacy of antioxidants in the prevention of colorectal adenomas. A meta-analysis of eight controlled trials found no convincing evidence that antioxidant supplements had a significant beneficial effect on primary or secondary prevention of colorectal adenomas [312].
Bisphosphonates — Oral bisphosphonates are commonly used for the treatment of osteoporosis. (See "Bisphosphonate therapy for the treatment of osteoporosis".)
The possibility that long-term bisphosphonate use was associated with a reduced risk of CRC was initially suggested in two case-control studies and one cohort study [313-315], but not confirmed in a third case-control study [316] or a prospective cohort study [317].
A meta-analysis of three of these case-control studies with a total of 16,998 CRC cases and 108,197 controls, and one cohort study with 94,405 individuals exposed to bisphosphonates and 283,181 unexposed to bisphosphonates [313-316] suggested a marginally reduced risk of CRC with any exposure to oral bisphosphonates (odds ratio [OR] 0.71, 95% CI 0.78-0.97) [318]. The inverse relationship was statistically significant at a dose of 10 or more prescriptions, or one or more years of oral bisphosphonate use. However, there were two potential problems with this analysis:
●
Confounding factors may weaken the conclusions of this study. Obesity (body mass index [BMI] >30 kg/m2) is a risk factor for CRC, and patients with obesity included in the meta-analysis might have been exposed to bisphosphonates less frequently than were patients without obesity. The risk for CRC was adjusted for BMI in only two of the four included studies [319]. (See 'Obesity' above.)
●
For unclear reasons, the analysis did not include a second null study of a cohort of 86,277 females enrolled onto the Nurses' Health Study, 801 of whom developed CRC [317]. The age-adjusted HR for CRC among females who regularly used bisphosphonates was 0.92 (95% CI 0.73-1.14) and was further attenuated after adjustment for other risk factors (HR 1.04, 95% CI 0.82-1.33). Risk was not influenced by duration of therapy.
On the other hand, a later meta-analysis that did include the Nurses' Health Study data also concluded that the use of bisphosphonate was associated with a modestly reduced risk of CRC (pooled RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.81-0.98) [320].
Angiotensin II inhibition — In vitro and in vivo data suggest that angiotensin II is involved in promoting cancer development and that there is a relationship between angiotensin II inhibition and reduced colon cancer cell growth. However, several observational studies and secondary analyses of data from clinical trials examining the relationship between antihypertensive therapy with an angiotensin II-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) and CRC risk have yielded conflicting results [321-324]:
●
A cohort study reported that long-term use of lisinopril was associated with a 41 percent reduction in the risk of advanced colorectal adenoma [321].
●
Another case-control study assessing ACE-I exposure among 665 patients with CRC failed to demonstrate a significant association; however, the sample size was small and the duration of exposure was short [322].
●
A secondary analysis of data from randomized trials also did not find an association between use of an ACE-I or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) and CRC risk, although the follow-up durations in the included trials were relatively short [323].
●
By contrast, a nested case-control study among a cohort of patients with hypertension in the EPIC General Practice Research Database provides modest evidence of a potential protective effect of angiotensin II inhibition on CRC risk [324]. Overall, 2847 case patients (diagnosed with CRC after the diagnosis of hypertension) were matched (for age, sex, calendar year, and duration of follow-up) with 28,239 controls, and the average duration of follow-up in both groups was 4.4 years. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) for CRC was 0.84 (95% CI 0.72-0.98) for three or more years of ACE-I/ARB therapy and 0.75 (95% CI 0.58-0.97) for five or more years of exposure. The strength of the association increased with higher dose therapy (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.35-0.79 for three or more years of high-dose exposure). CRC rates were significantly lower among patients exposed to ACE-I/ARB therapy alone when compared with those exposed to other antihypertensive agents exclusive of angiotensin inhibition.
Taken together, these observational data suggest a potential protective effect of angiotensin II inhibition on CRC risk that is more evident in those receiving long-term and high daily dose therapies, but no intervention trials have thus far shown such an effect.
INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS
UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, "The Basics" and "Beyond the Basics." The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5th to 6th grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10th to 12th grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.
Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on "patient info" and the keyword(s) of interest.)

SUMMARY
●
Risk factors and influence on screening recommendations
•
The major factors that increase the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) and influence screening recommendations are certain hereditary forms of CRC, age, a personal or family history of sporadic CRC (and possibly large or advanced adenomas), inflammatory bowel disease, and a history of abdominal irradiation. (See 'Factors that influence screening recommendations' above.)
•
Several potentially modifiable factors, including obesity, diabetes, tobacco use, excess consumption of alcohol, excess consumption of processed meat, and lack of physical activity, have been consistently identified as risk factors in observational studies, but at present, they do not alter screening recommendations. Patients may be counseled about these associations and encouraged to reduce or avoid such factors for the primary prevention of CRC. (See 'Risk factors that do not alter screening recommendations' above.)
•
Other risk factors have been identified, including race, sex, acromegaly, and a history of renal transplantation, but their influence on screening recommendations has been variable. (See 'Factors that may influence screening recommendations' above.)
•
There is a global epidemiologic trend towards early onset colorectal cancer (EOCRC), or the diagnosis of CRC in people under the age of 50 years. Efforts to reduce the incidence and mortality of EOCRC include assessing for potential modifiable risk factors, identifying individuals eligible for earlier CRC surveillance, and promoting both clinician and patient awareness of the potential symptoms associated with CRC (eg, persistent rectal bleeding at any age). (See 'Early onset colorectal cancer' above.)
●
Protective factors
•
A substantial body of evidence supports a protective effect of aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) on the development of colonic adenomas and cancer. The potential role of aspirin and other NSAIDs in CRC prevention is discussed separately. (See "Aspirin in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer" and "NSAIDs (including aspirin): Role in prevention of colorectal cancer".)
•
Other protective factors have also been identified, mainly in observational studies, but the strength of some of these associations is uncertain. (See 'Protective factors' above.)
•
Specific types of diets may reduce the risk of CRC. Despite the uncertainty, a protective diet can be defined for clinical purposes to include avoidance of processed and charred red meat, inclusion of vegetables (especially cruciferous) and unprocessed forms of wheat bran (controversial), an adequate amount of folate intake from food, limited caloric intake, and avoidance of excessive alcohol.

INTRODUCTION
Listeria monocytogenes is an important bacterial pathogen in immunosuppressed patients, individuals at the extremes of age including neonates and older adults, pregnant women, and, occasionally, previously healthy individuals. Invasion of the central nervous system (meningitis or meningoencephalitis) and bacteremia are the principal clinical manifestations of listerial infection in these hosts. In contrast, normal hosts who ingest high numbers of Listeria may develop self-limited febrile gastroenteritis.
The epidemiology, microbiology, and pathogenesis of listerial infection will be reviewed here. The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and prevention of listerial infections are discussed separately. (See "Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Listeria monocytogenes infection" and "Treatment and prevention of Listeria monocytogenes infection".)
MICROBIOLOGY
L. monocytogenes is the only Listeria species that regularly infects humans, although rare cases of human infections with Listeria ivanovii (a pathogen of ruminants) and Listeria grayi have been reported [1,2]. Listeria is an aerobic and facultatively anaerobic, motile, beta-hemolytic, non–spore-forming, short, gram-positive rod that exhibits characteristic tumbling motility by light microscopy (movie 1 and picture 1) [3,4]. Listeria occurs singly or in short chains. On Gram stain, Listeria may resemble pneumococci (diplococci), enterococci, or diphtheroids (Corynebacteria) or be gram variable and be confused with Haemophilus species (picture 2) [3-5]. In particular, when a positive blood or cerebrospinal fluid culture is preliminarily identified as diphtheroids, the clinician should consider the possibility that the isolate represents Listeria [3].
Listeria produces a characteristic appearance on blood agar with small zones of clear beta-hemolysis around each colony (picture 3). Listeria grows well at refrigeration temperatures (4° to 10°C). Rarely, the "cold enrichment" technique and selective media are used when attempting to isolate Listeria from mixed cultures, such as stool [4].
PATHOGENESIS
Listeria is a facultative intracellular parasite [6]. The primary habitat of Listeria is the soil and decaying vegetable matter. Most Listeria infections in adults are thought to result from oral ingestion and subsequent intestinal mucosal penetration and systemic infection (movie 2).

INTRODUCTION
Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) is a combination of endoscopy and ultrasonography. Conventional echoendoscopes operate across ultrasound frequencies ranging from 6 to 12 MHz, resulting in a spectrum of penetration depth and image resolution. Higher frequencies provide higher resolution but less penetration, while lower frequencies provide higher penetration but lower resolution.
Advances in technology have led to the development of small caliber ultrasound probes (commonly referred to as miniprobes or EUS miniprobes). Because miniprobes have a small outer diameter, they can be introduced through the accessory channel of a standard endoscope and can produce EUS imaging at anatomic locations (eg, ascending colon, cecum) that are not reachable with an echoendoscope. In addition, miniprobes scan at higher frequencies (12 to 20 MHz) than echoendoscopes, and this results in high resolution imaging with a penetration depth of approximately 20 mm.
This topic will review imaging principles, procedure technique, and clinical applications of EUS imaging with a miniprobe.
The indications, contraindications, and technical aspects related to performing conventional EUS (ie, echoendoscope-guided examination) are discussed separately. (See "Endoscopic ultrasound: Examination of the upper gastrointestinal tract".)
EUS-guided sampling technique and therapeutic interventions are also discussed separately:

INTRODUCTION
Gas in the pleural space is termed "pneumothorax." A spontaneous pneumothorax is that which occurs in the absence of an external event. Determining the etiology of pneumothorax dictates immediate and definitive management. Thus, the clinician needs to be familiar with the wide array of etiologies when faced with pneumothorax so that appropriate therapy can be administered promptly to prevent deterioration and recurrence (table 1).
In this topic review, the epidemiology and etiology of pneumothorax are discussed. Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of pneumothorax are reviewed in detail elsewhere. (See "Clinical presentation and diagnosis of pneumothorax" and "Treatment of secondary spontaneous pneumothorax in adults" and "Treatment of primary spontaneous pneumothorax in adults" and "Pneumothorax: Definitive management and prevention of recurrence".)
PRIMARY SPONTANEOUS PNEUMOTHORAX
Definition — A primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) is traditionally defined as a pneumothorax which presents without a precipitating external event in the absence of clinical lung disease. Although PSP is not associated with known clinical lung disease (eg, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD]), most affected patients have unrecognized lung abnormalities (mostly subpleural blebs) that likely predispose to pneumothorax [1-5]. However, following investigation, some patients with apparent PSP may have other more serious underlying lung diseases (eg, Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome, thoracic endometriosis, lymphangioleiomyomatosis), thereby recategorizing them as having secondary spontaneous pneumothorax (SSP). Thus, many experts believe that the distinction between pneumothorax in patients "without" lung disease (ie, pneumothorax with subpleural blebs, also known as PSP) and pneumothorax in patients with lung diseases (ie, SSP) is somewhat artificial, and that PSP and SSP may exist on either end of a continuum [6].
Epidemiology — PSP is more common in males than females (roughly three to six times higher). The incidence of PSP in males ranges from 7.4 per 100,000 population per year in the United States to 37 per 100,000 population per year in the United Kingdom. The incidence in females ranges from 1.2 per 100,000 population per year in the United States to 15.4 per 100,000 population per year in the United Kingdom [7]. The reason for these geographic differences is unknown. Another hospital database study of emergency department visits from January 2008 to December 2014 reported that 79 percent of pneumothoraces were in males and 21 percent in females [8].
The prevalence of asymptomatic PSP is unknown, but one retrospective study of Japanese students suggested that the rate may be as high as 0.042 percent and higher in males than females [9]. Mild collapse (ie, <10 percent collapse) was present in approximately half of individuals, most of whom underwent intervention.

INTRODUCTION
Most chemotherapeutic agents target rapidly dividing cells, and effects on these cells within the gastrointestinal tract can lead to a variety of symptoms. Diarrhea caused by chemotherapy, referred to here as chemotherapy-related diarrhea (CRD), is a serious and potentially life-threatening complication of a wide variety of chemotherapy drugs and hospital admission is frequently needed for adequate supportive care. CRD may also result in treatment delays and diminished compliance, which may compromise long-term outcomes.
This topic will review the management of CRD. The pathogenesis of CRD, predictive markers for fluoropyrimidine- and irinotecan-related diarrhea, and management of diarrhea in patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors are discussed in detail separately. (See "Clinical presentation and risk factors for chemotherapy-associated diarrhea, constipation, and intestinal perforation", section on 'Diarrhea' and "Immune checkpoint inhibitor colitis".)
AGENTS MOST COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH DIARRHEA
●
Conventional cytotoxic agents – CRD is a common problem in cancer patients receiving systemic antineoplastic therapy, and is most often described with fluoropyrimidines (particularly fluorouracil [FU] and capecitabine) and irinotecan. Diarrhea is often the dose-limiting and major toxicity of regimens containing a fluoropyrimidine with irinotecan. The frequency of severe (grade 3 or 4 (table 1)) diarrhea with these agents ranges from 5 to 44 percent, and rates vary according to the dose, the specific agents administered, and the schedule of administration. (See "Clinical presentation and risk factors for chemotherapy-associated diarrhea, constipation, and intestinal perforation", section on 'Fluorouracil' and "Clinical presentation and risk factors for chemotherapy-associated diarrhea, constipation, and intestinal perforation", section on 'Irinotecan'.)
●
Molecularly targeted agents – In addition to conventional cytotoxic drugs, such as fluoropyrimidines and irinotecan, several molecularly targeted agents are also associated with high rates of CRD:
•
For many tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as afatinib, ceritinib, cabozantinib, lenvatinib, osimertinib, and tucatinib, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors (eg, alpelisib), diarrhea is second only to rash as the most common toxicity. Diarrhea develops in one-half or more of treated patients, although the incidence of severe (grade 3 or 4) diarrhea is lower than with conventional cytotoxic agents. Diarrhea is especially common with ceritinib, neratinib, and afatinib, occurring in 75 to 95 percent of treated patients, but severe in only 2 to 16 percent. (See "Clinical presentation and risk factors for chemotherapy-associated diarrhea, constipation, and intestinal perforation", section on 'Small molecule EGFR inhibitors' and "Clinical presentation and risk factors for chemotherapy-associated diarrhea, constipation, and intestinal perforation", section on 'Small molecule inhibitors of VEGFR' and "Clinical presentation and risk factors for chemotherapy-associated diarrhea, constipation, and intestinal perforation", section on 'Lapatinib, pertuzumab, neratinib, and tucatinib' and "Clinical presentation and risk factors for chemotherapy-associated diarrhea, constipation, and intestinal perforation", section on 'ALK inhibitors'.)

INTRODUCTION
Liver transplantation is the treatment of choice for appropriately selected patients with end-stage liver disease. With improved long-term survival, more patients are being cared for outside of a transplant center, requiring more widespread familiarity with the complications seen in this patient population. Several medical problems are routinely encountered by clinicians caring for patients after liver transplantation. These include:
●
Acute or chronic rejection.
●
Complications of immunosuppression including hypertension, kidney insufficiency, infection, malignancy, a variety of dermatologic conditions, and metabolic diseases such as diabetes mellitus, obesity, hyperlipidemia, and bone disease.
●
Biliary complications.
●
Recurrence of the primary liver disease.

INTRODUCTION
Gastric polyps are usually found incidentally on upper gastrointestinal endoscopy performed for an unrelated indication and only in rare cases do they cause symptoms. Nevertheless, the diagnosis and appropriate management of gastric polyps are important, as some polyps have malignant potential.
This topic will review the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, histopathology, and management of gastric polyps. Our recommendations are largely consistent with the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy guidelines [1,2]. The clinical manifestations, diagnosis and management of gastric gastrointestinal stromal tumors, leiomyomas, lipomas, and other subepithelial lesions that may have a polypoid appearance on upper endoscopy are discussed in detail, separately. (See "Endoscopic ultrasound for the characterization of subepithelial lesions of the upper gastrointestinal tract" and "Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and prognosis of gastrointestinal stromal tumors" and "Local treatment for gastrointestinal stromal tumors, leiomyomas, and leiomyosarcomas of the gastrointestinal tract".)
EPIDEMIOLOGY
Gastric polyps are found in approximately 6 percent of upper gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures in the United States [3]. However, lower rates have been reported in other countries [4,5]. Hyperplastic polyps and adenomas are relatively more prevalent as compared with fundic gland polyps in regions where Helicobacter pylori infection is common [4-6]. In contrast, in Western countries, where the prevalence of H. pylori infection is lower and proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use is common, the most commonly encountered polyps are fundic gland polyps (picture 1A-B) [3,6].
INITIAL EVALUATION
The initial approach to gastric polyps should include an evaluation of both polyp histology and the surrounding mucosa.
●
Evaluation of polyp histology – In patients with small solitary polyps, either biopsy samples should be obtained or polypectomy performed so that the polyp can be examined microscopically for histologic characterization [7-11]. Polypectomy should be performed for all known neoplastic polyps and for all polyps ≥1 cm in diameter, as biopsies alone cannot exclude foci of high-grade dysplasia or early gastric cancer [9]. In patients with multiple polyps, the largest polyp should be excised and representative biopsies obtained from the remaining polyps [1,2]. In patients with sessile polyps, endoscopic mucosal resection may be needed to provide an accurate histological assessment and achieve complete resection. Further management should be based on histology [12]. (See "Overview of endoscopic resection of gastrointestinal lesions" and 'Types of gastric polyps and specific management' below.)

INTRODUCTION
Confocal laser endomicroscopy and endocytoscopy are endoscopic technologies that permit high-resolution assessment of gastrointestinal mucosal histology at a cellular and sub-cellular level. Endomicroscopy and endocytoscopy dramatically expand the imaging capabilities of flexible endoscopy by their ability to obtain "optical biopsies" of nearly any accessible endoluminal surface.
The examinations are carried out in vivo with real-time image display. The techniques have primarily been applied to the differentiation of colon polyps and for the detection of dysplasia and neoplasia in conditions such as Barrett's esophagus and ulcerative colitis. Since the first visible neoplastic changes in epithelial cancers occur at a cellular level, these imaging techniques may allow for earlier diagnosis and treatment. In addition, confocal laser endomicroscopy and endocytoscopy may allow for targeted biopsies of abnormal mucosa, thereby decreasing the number of biopsies required to diagnose dysplasia or neoplasia while increasing diagnostic yield.
This topic will review confocal laser endomicroscopy and endocytoscopy, including the technical aspects of the procedures, their indications, and efficacies. Chromoendoscopy, magnification endoscopy, and narrow band imaging are discussed elsewhere. (See "Chromoendoscopy" and "Magnification endoscopy" and "Barrett's esophagus: Evaluation with optical chromoscopy".)
TECHNICAL OVERVIEW
Confocal laser endomicroscopy — Confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) is based upon the principle of illuminating a tissue with a low-power laser and then detecting fluorescent light reflected from the tissue [1]. The laser is focused at a specific depth and only light reflected back from that plane is refocused and able to pass through the pinhole confocal aperture. As a result, scattered light from above and below the plane of interest is not detected, increasing spatial resolution. The area being examined is scanned in the horizontal and vertical planes and an image is reconstructed. In this manner, microscopic imaging of biologic tissue in vivo is possible due to the high lateral resolution of confocal imaging.
Since CLE relies upon tissue fluorescence, intravenous and/or topically applied contrast agents are required. Intravenous fluorescein is used to highlight the vasculature, lamina propria, and intracellular spaces of this tissue being examined. However, it does not stain cell nuclei. Nuclear staining can be achieved using topical contrast agents such as acriflavine and cresyl violet, but there is concern over mutagenic potential with the topical agents.

INTRODUCTION
Abdominal tuberculosis (TB) includes involvement of the gastrointestinal tract, peritoneum, lymph nodes, and/or solid organs [1-4]. Abdominal TB comprises around 5 percent of all cases of TB worldwide [5].
Issues related to TB involving the intestinal tract, peritoneum, and liver will be reviewed here; issues related to clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of pulmonary TB are discussed separately. (See "Pulmonary tuberculosis disease in adults: Clinical manifestations and complications" and "Diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis in adults" and "Treatment of drug-susceptible pulmonary tuberculosis in nonpregnant adults without HIV infection".)
RISK FACTORS
Risk factors for development of abdominal TB include cirrhosis, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, diabetes mellitus, underlying malignancy, malnutrition, treatment with antitumor necrosis factor agents [6], corticosteroids, and use of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis [7-11]. Issues related to the epidemiology of TB are discussed further separately. (See "Epidemiology of tuberculosis".)
FORMS OF DISEASE
Abdominal TB can present with involvement of any of the following sites: peritoneum, stomach, intestinal tract, hepatobiliary tree, pancreas, perianal area, and lymph nodes. The most common forms of disease include involvement of the peritoneum, intestine, and/or lymph nodes.
TB of the abdomen may occur via reactivation of latent TB infection or by ingestion of tuberculous mycobacteria (as with ingestion of unpasteurized milk or undercooked meat). In the setting of active pulmonary TB or miliary TB, abdominal involvement may develop via hematogenous spread via contiguous spread of TB from adjacent organs (such as retrograde spread from the fallopian tubes) or via spread through lymphatic channels [2].

INTRODUCTION
Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic progressive disorder of unknown etiology that is characterized by inflammation, fibrosis, and stricturing of medium and large ducts in the intrahepatic and/or extrahepatic biliary tree (picture 1) [1-3].
This topic will review the clinical manifestations and diagnosis of PSC. The treatment of PSC is discussed separately. (See "Primary sclerosing cholangitis in adults: Management".)
Our approach is largely consistent with the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [4], the European Association for the Study of Liver [5], and the American College of Gastroenterology [6]. The discussion that follows is generally consistent with these guidelines.
EPIDEMIOLOGY
Incidence and prevalence — Estimates of the incidence of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) vary in Europe and North America. In a systematic review of population-based studies, the incidence of PSC was highest in studies performed in Northern Europe and North America as compared with the Mediterranean basin (Finland 1.6 per 100,000, United States 1.5 per 100,000 and Italy 0.1 per 100,000) [7]. In the studies that evaluated temporal trends, an increase in the prevalence of PSC has been noted over time [8]. Median transplant-free survival ranged from 9.7 years in the United States to 20.6 years in the Netherlands.
In a study performed in the United Kingdom, the incidence of PSC was 0.68 (95% CI 0.45-0.99) per 100,000 person-years and the age-standardized prevalence was 5.58 (95% CI 4.82-7.35) per 100,000 person-years [9]. The mortality rate per 1000 person-years was threefold higher in PSC than population controls (49.5 versus 16.1; incidence rate ratio 3.1, 95% CI 2.2-4.2) [9].

INTRODUCTION
Diverticular disease of the colon is an important cause of hospital admissions and a significant contributor to health care costs in industrialized nations [1,2]. In Western countries, the majority of patients present with sigmoid diverticulitis [3,4].
Most patients with acute sigmoid diverticulitis are treated medically; surgery is only indicated when diverticulitis is either not amenable or is refractory to medical therapy (algorithm 1) [5-8]. Approximately 15 percent of patients will require surgery for diverticular disease [7]. In the United States, diverticular disease is the leading indication for elective colon surgery [9]. For patients who require surgery for diverticulitis, the choice of techniques depends upon the patient's hemodynamic stability, extent of peritoneal contamination, and surgeon experience/preference [10].
Surgical treatment of acute colonic diverticulitis and its acute complications (perforation, abscess formation, or intractability) is described here. Diverticular fistulas, bleeding, and stricture/obstruction, which are typically subacute or chronic sequelae of diverticulitis, are discussed in other topics:

INTRODUCTION
Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) of the pancreas are potentially malignant intraductal epithelial neoplasms that are grossly visible (typically >10 mm) and are composed of mucin-producing columnar cells. The lesions show papillary proliferation, cyst formation, and varying degrees of cellular atypia [1,2].
IPMNs may involve the main pancreatic duct, the branch ducts, or both. Whereas patients with branch-duct lesions are at lower risk for developing malignancy (approximately 20 percent at 10 years), patients with IPMNs involving the main duct are at high risk (approximately 70 percent). As a result, these lesions need to be accurately diagnosed and characterized so that appropriate treatment can be recommended. (See "Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm of the pancreas (IPMN): Pathophysiology and clinical manifestations", section on 'Classification' and "Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm of the pancreas (IPMN): Pathophysiology and clinical manifestations", section on 'Pancreatic malignancy'.)
This topic will review the evaluation and management of IPMNs. The pathophysiology and clinical manifestations of IPMNs and an overview of the diagnostic approach to pancreatic cystic neoplasms are discussed separately. (See "Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm of the pancreas (IPMN): Pathophysiology and clinical manifestations" and "Classification of pancreatic cysts" and "Pancreatic cystic neoplasms: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management".)
DIAGNOSIS
The approach to the diagnosis of pancreatic cystic neoplasms typically starts with cross-sectional imaging (magnetic resonance imaging with magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography or computed tomography). Additional evaluation with endoscopic ultrasound with fine-needle aspiration may be needed to confirm a diagnosis or to assess for malignant features. The diagnostic approach to pancreatic cystic neoplasms is discussed separately. (See "Pancreatic cystic neoplasms: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management".)
EVALUATION FOR MALIGNANCY
The evaluation of a patient with an intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) aims to determine if the patient has or is at high-risk of developing a malignancy [3]. Resection is typically recommended for IPMNs with high-grade dysplasia (carcinoma in situ), IPMNs that have progressed to invasive carcinoma (also referred to as invasive IPMN or malignant IPMN), and IPMNs with features concerning for malignancy or that are at high risk for developing malignancy. IPMNs not meeting these criteria are typically followed with surveillance imaging. (See 'Management' below.)

INTRODUCTION
Aortoenteric fistulae (AEFs), first described in the early 19th century by Sir Astley Cooper [1], are uncommon but life-threatening conditions. AEF is defined as an abnormal connection between the aorta and the gastrointestinal tract. It is most often the result of compression of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) against (primary), or erosion of an aortic prosthetic graft into (secondary), the surrounding gastrointestinal structures.
The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of AEFs are reviewed here. The management of asymptomatic and general management of symptomatic AAAs are discussed separately. (See "Management of asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm" and "Management of symptomatic (non-ruptured) and ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm".)
DEFINITION AND CLASSIFICATION
AEF is a rare but potentially lethal disease. AEF is defined as an abnormal communication between the aorta (or aortoiliac tree) and the gastrointestinal system. It is most frequently due to primary aortic compression (eg, abdominal aortic aneurysm) against, or erosion of an aortic prosthetic graft into, the neighboring gastrointestinal organs.
Not all AEF are equal. Whereas intrusion into the duodenum or small bowel by a synthetic graft has been labeled an "AEF," this is more of an aortic enteric erosion (AEE). While AEE may eventually lead to a full-blown AEF, the prognosis for AEE is much better than an AEF [2].
AEFs are most commonly a communication between the aorta and the gastrointestinal tract. However, the aorta can fistulize to other organs concomitantly with the gastrointestinal tract or to other organs independent of the gastrointestinal tract [3-5].

INTRODUCTION
Radiation therapy (RT) represents an important therapeutic component in the management of many gynecologic malignancies. Based upon evidence-based treatment guidelines, RT is indicated in up to 60 percent of cervical cancer patients, 45 percent of endometrial cancer patients, 35 percent of vulvar cancer patients, 100 percent of vaginal cancer patients, and 5 percent of patients with ovarian cancer [1,2].
In this topic, the spectrum of both acute and late side effects associated with RT, specifically as it relates to the treatment of gynecologic malignancies, will be reviewed. An understanding of potential side effects is important for patient management and survivorship issues. An overview of the general principles, modalities, and techniques of RT is found elsewhere. A more detailed discussion of the indications for RT for specific cancer sites and stages can be found in topic reviews for each cancer site. (See "Radiation therapy techniques in cancer treatment".)
OVERVIEW
RT for gynecologic cancers can be employed as primary (definitive) treatment, following surgery (adjuvant), or before surgery (neoadjuvant) in order to reduce the risk of recurrence. For some tumors, RT often is administered with concurrent chemotherapy (chemoradiation) and may incorporate brachytherapy. The normal tissues of the cervix and corpus of the uterus can tolerate high doses of radiation and can recover remarkably well from radiation injury. However, the surrounding normal tissues are more susceptible to radiation injury.
The incidence and severity of RT side effects depend upon the site, volume of tissue exposed, and treatment schedule, including total dose, dose per fraction, and type of radiation. Modifying factors such as previous surgery, concomitant chemotherapy, and comorbid illness also are influential. At least one large report indicates that smoking history is a strong predictor for both bowel and bladder complications from treatment [3].
Some patients may be at higher risk for RT-related toxicity. These include patients with:

INTRODUCTION
Opioids represent a mainstay for treatment of severe chronic pain in patients with active cancer or other serious chronic illnesses. Although the side effect liability of these drugs is significant and they are inherently associated with serious problems of substance use disorder and addiction, experience in the management of cancer pain indicates that they can potentially be used safely and effectively for all types of pain (ie, somatic, visceral, neuropathic). (See "Cancer pain management with opioids: Optimizing analgesia" and "Cancer pain management: General principles and risk management for patients receiving opioids".)
The term "chronic non-cancer pain" is ill defined but generally understood to apply to common types of musculoskeletal pain syndromes, such as arthritis and low back pain, and to headache. The long-term use of opioid drugs for these conditions is more controversial than use for cancer-related pain. For patients with chronic non-cancer pain, the decision to begin opioid therapy must be weighed carefully. (See "Use of opioids in the management of chronic pain in adults" and "Pharmacologic management of chronic non-cancer pain in adults", section on 'Opioids'.)
The public health consequences of opioid abuse drive the imperative that all clinicians assume responsibility for risk management when these drugs are prescribed for legitimate medical purposes. This applies to opioid use of any type in any population. (See "Cancer pain management: General principles and risk management for patients receiving opioids", section on 'Risk assessment and management for patients receiving opioids' and "Opioid use disorder: Epidemiology, clinical features, health consequences, screening, and assessment" and "Use of opioids in the management of chronic pain in adults", section on 'Evaluation of risk prior to initiating therapy'.)
Opioid therapy is associated with numerous side effects, the most common of which are gastrointestinal or neurologic. There is marked interindividual variability in the sensitivity to adverse effects from opioids, which may be due to genetic differences, age, comorbidity, or interactions with other drugs. The assessment and management of side effects is a best practice during opioid therapy. In many cases, however, a favorable balance between analgesia and side effects cannot be attained, a situation that may be termed "poor responsiveness." When a patient undergoing dose titration is determined be poorly responsive to a specific opioid, there are several approaches to consider: improving the symptomatic management of the dose-limiting side effect, changing to an alternative opioid (opioid rotation), or adding another therapy (a nonopioid analgesic, an adjuvant analgesic, or a nonpharmacologic treatment) that may improve analgesia even as the opioid dose is lowered.
This topic review will cover the prevention and management of specific adverse events in patients receiving chronic opioid therapy. Management of side effects in patients receiving opioid therapy for acute pain in the postoperative or acute critical illness settings is discussed elsewhere. (See "Pain control in the critically ill adult patient", section on 'Adverse effects of opioid analgesics'.)

INTRODUCTION
Although a distended, mucus-filled appendix is often called a mucocele, this term is ambiguous and best utilized to describe an imaging appearance rather than a pathologic entity. The underlying biology and behavior of appendiceal mucinous lesions are variable and can range from non-neoplastic to neoplastic.
This topic will review the epidemiology, clinical manifestations and diagnosis, and management of appendiceal mucinous lesions. Nonmucinous tumors of the appendix are discussed separately. (See "Epithelial tumors of the appendix" and "Well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors of the appendix".)
Other causes of ileocecal lesions, including tuberculosis, typhlitis, actinomycosis, carcinoid tumors, and lesions due to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, are also discussed separately. (See "Neutropenic enterocolitis (typhlitis)" and "Clinical characteristics of well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors arising in the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts" and "NSAIDs: Adverse effects on the distal small bowel and colon".)
TERMINOLOGY
The classification of appendiceal mucinous lesions has evolved over time [1]. A consensus classification is available from the Peritoneal Surface Oncology Group International (PSOGI) [2,3].

INTRODUCTION
Hemorrhoids are collections of submucosal, fibrovascular, arteriovenous sinusoids that are part of the normal anorectum [1]. In epidemiologic studies conducted in Korea, England, and Austria, between 14 and 39 percent of the population had hemorrhoids; however, many were without symptoms [2-4]. Hemorrhoids without any symptoms do not require treatment.
By contrast, an estimated 10 million people in the United States complained of hemorrhoids, corresponding to a prevalence of 4.4 percent [5]. The most common complaint associated with hemorrhoidal disease is painless rectal bleeding during defecation with or without tissue prolapse. Other typical symptoms include anal pruritus or pain and a lump at the anal verge due to thrombosis or strangulation [2]. (See "Hemorrhoids: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis", section on 'Clinical manifestations'.)
Those presenting for symptomatic hemorrhoids probably represent a group with relatively severe disease. Because a large variety of over-the-counter products are available and marketed for the treatment of hemorrhoids, patients often self-diagnose and self-treat before seeking medical attention. Incidentally, the quality of information about hemorrhoids on the internet is highly variable, and a significant proportion of websites assessed are poorly informed (40 percent in one study [6]).
Several options are available for the treatment of symptomatic hemorrhoids, and most patients with low-grade internal hemorrhoids will have relief with home-based conservative treatment or office-based procedures that are reviewed in this topic. Surgery is indicated for low-grade hemorrhoids that are refractory to home- or office-based treatments, high-grade hemorrhoids, and complicated hemorrhoids. Surgical treatment of hemorrhoids is reviewed separately. (See "Surgical treatment of hemorrhoidal disease".)
CLASSIFICATION OF HEMORRHOIDS
Hemorrhoids are classified relative to their relationship to the dentate line (figure 1):

INTRODUCTION
Chagas disease is caused by infection with the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi; the major manifestations are Chagas cardiomyopathy and gastrointestinal disease [1].
Issues related to the epidemiology and prevention of Chagas disease, acute and chronic Chagas infection, and cardiac Chagas are discussed separately. (See "Chagas disease: Epidemiology, screening, and prevention" and "Chagas disease: Acute and congenital Trypanosoma cruzi infection" and "Chagas disease: Chronic Trypanosoma cruzi infection" and "Chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis" and "Chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy: Management and prognosis".)
EPIDEMIOLOGY
Among individuals with the chronic indeterminate form of Chagas disease, approximately 30 percent progress over a period of one to three decades to clinically evident cardiac involvement, digestive involvement, or both [2]. Gastrointestinal involvement is less common (10 to 21 percent). The mortality associated with Chagas gastrointestinal disease is low, but symptoms can considerably impact the quality of life. It is relatively rare in the setting of reactivation of chronic T. cruzi infection among organ transplant recipients or in patients with HIV infection, although there are reports of parasitic invasion of the peritoneum, intestine, stomach, esophagus, or larynx. (See "Chagas disease in the immunosuppressed host".)
The likelihood of digestive involvement may vary by region [3]. The digestive form is observed more frequently in the countries of the Southern Cone of South America and is rare in northern South America, Central America, and Mexico [4]. A high prevalence has been observed in the central region of Brazil. This geographic pattern is thought to be due to the distribution of different T. cruzi genotypes [5].
The burden of the gastrointestinal form can be enormous for some countries. In one study that evaluated hospitalization rates due to Chagas disease in Brazil between 2017 to 2019, there were 0.6 hospitalizations per 100,000 inhabitants, with significant regional variation. Hospitalizations increased with age and were slightly higher in males. More than 60 percent were emergencies and 50 percent were surgical procedures. In-hospital mortality was 5.8 percent and 17.2 percent went to intensive care units [6].

INTRODUCTION
Surgical resection is the cornerstone of curative therapy for patients with early stage, potentially resectable rectal cancer. The type of surgery depends on tumor stage and location within the rectum. Superficially invasive, small cancers may be effectively managed with limited surgery (such as local excision). However, most patients have more deeply invasive tumors that require low anterior resection or, in some cases, if located distally, abdominoperineal resection. Locally advanced tumors that are adherent or fixed to adjoining structures (eg, sacrum, pelvic sidewalls, prostate, or bladder) require more extensive surgery. (See "Surgical treatment of rectal cancer" and "Treatment of locally recurrent rectal adenocarcinoma".)
The combination of adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) and chemotherapy can enhance local control and cure rates in patients with either transmural invasion (T3/T4) or regional lymph node involvement (table 1). (See "Adjuvant therapy for resected rectal adenocarcinoma in patients not receiving neoadjuvant therapy".)
Increasingly, such therapy is administered preoperatively. The more favorable long-term toxicity profile and better local control with preoperative as compared with postoperative long-course chemoradiotherapy for transmural or node-positive rectal cancer were shown in the seminal German Rectal Cancer Study Group trial. Subsequently, benefit has been shown for neoadjuvant short-course RT alone, although this approach is more popular outside of the United States. More recently, the concept of "total neoadjuvant therapy," in which both RT and adjuvant systemic chemotherapy are administered preoperatively, is gaining popularity for locally advanced tumors. (See "Neoadjuvant therapy for rectal adenocarcinoma" and "Neoadjuvant therapy for rectal adenocarcinoma", section on 'Total neoadjuvant therapy for locally advanced tumors'.)
Although there is not universal agreement, neoadjuvant approaches are generally considered for T3/T4 and/or clinically node-positive T1/T2 tumors (table 1), distal rectal tumors (ie, tumors within 5 cm of the anal verge (figure 1)) for which preoperative chemoradiotherapy may enhance the ability to preserve the anal sphincter, and tumors that appear to invade or are in close proximity to the mesorectal fascia on preoperative imaging because of the decreased likelihood of achieving a tumor-free circumferential resection margin (CRM) with upfront surgery. (See "Neoadjuvant therapy for rectal adenocarcinoma", section on 'Indications for neoadjuvant therapy'.)
The selection of appropriate patients for initial RT or chemoradiotherapy rather than surgery is heavily dependent on accurate preoperative locoregional staging of the depth of transmural penetration, the presence or absence of suspicious perirectal nodes, and the likely status of the CRM. Locoregional tumor staging is mainly accomplished through physical examination, endoscopy, computed tomography (CT) scans, magnetic resonance imaging, and transrectal endoscopic ultrasound (TEUS).

INTRODUCTION
Neoplasms of the appendix are rare. They are found in approximately 1 percent of appendectomy specimens [1,2] and account for only approximately 0.5 of 1 percent of intestinal neoplasms [3].
Appendiceal neoplasms comprise several histologic types:
●
Epithelial neoplasms include invasive adenocarcinomas, low-grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasms, and goblet cell adenocarcinomas. Histologically, goblet cell adenocarcinomas (previously called goblet cell carcinoids or adenocarcinoids) have features of both adenocarcinomas and well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). They are more aggressive than well-differentiated NETs [4] and are classified and staged as appendiceal carcinomas [5]. (See "Epithelial tumors of the appendix" and "Appendiceal mucinous lesions".)
●
Neuroendocrine neoplasms of the gastrointestinal tract include well-differentiated NETs (grades 1, 2, and 3), poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas (large cell and small cell types), and mixed neuroendocrine-non-neuroendocrine neoplasms (MiNEN) [6].
MiNEN typically show a combination of neuroendocrine carcinoma and adenocarcinoma, and these tumors are treated like high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas. (See "Poorly differentiated gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine carcinoma".)

COLONOSCOPY OVERVIEW
A colonoscopy is an exam of the lower part of the gastrointestinal tract, which is called the colon or large intestine (bowel). Colonoscopy is a safe procedure that provides information other tests may not be able to give.
Colonoscopy is performed by inserting a device called a colonoscope into the anus and advancing through the entire colon (figure 1). The procedure generally takes between 20 minutes and one hour.
Other tests that are sometimes used to screen for colon cancer, like virtual colonoscopy (also called CT colonography), are discussed separately. (See "Patient education: Screening for colorectal cancer (Beyond the Basics)".)
More detailed information about colonoscopy is available by subscription. (See "Tests for screening for colorectal cancer".)
REASONS FOR COLONOSCOPY
The most common reasons for colonoscopy are:
●
To screen for colon polyps (growths of tissue in the colon) or colon cancer
●
Rectal bleeding
●
A change in bowel habits, like persistent diarrhea
●
Iron deficiency anemia (a decrease in blood count due to loss of iron
●
Chronic, unexplained abdominal or rectal pain
●
An abnormal x-ray exam, like a barium enema or CT scan
The timing of colonoscopy generally depends on risk factors such as having a family history of colon cancer or polyps or having a personal history of colon cancer or polyps.
COLONOSCOPY PREPARATION
Before colonoscopy, your colon must be completely cleaned out so that the doctor can see any abnormal areas. This is vitally important to increase the chances that your doctor will identify abnormalities in your colon. If your colon is not completely cleaned out, the chances your doctor will miss abnormalities increases. Your doctor's office will provide specific instructions about how you should prepare for your colonoscopy. Be sure to read these instructions as soon as you get them so you will know how to take the preparation and whether you need to make any changes to your medications or diet. If you have questions, call the doctor's office in advance.
You will need to avoid solid food for at least one day before the test. You should also drink plenty of clear fluids on the day before the test. You can drink clear liquids (a liquid you can hold up to the light and see through) up to several hours before your procedure, including:
●
Water
●
Clear broth (beef, chicken, or vegetable)
●
Coffee or tea (without milk)
●
Flavored ices
●
Gelatin such as Jell-O (avoid red gelatin)
Avoid drinking red liquids. Your doctor may also ask you to avoid high fiber foods including seeds and nuts for the week before the procedure.
To clean the colon, you will take a strong laxative and empty your bowels. You may be asked to take the entire preparation the night before the test, or you may be asked to take it in two doses, with the second dose taken four to six hours prior to the colonoscopy. Taking the preparation in two "split" doses may help get the colon even cleaner. This may require you to wake up early in the morning to complete the preparation. You may even be able to drink the entire solution the morning of the procedure if you are having the colonoscopy in the afternoon. The instructions you are given will tell you how you should take the preparation.
One type of preparation is a four-liter (one gallon) solution that you buy at the pharmacy with a prescription. Several lower-volume (two- to three-liter) preparations are on the market as well. Another option is citrate of magnesia (also called magnesium citrate), a 300 mL (10 ounce) bottle that requires no mixing and is over-the-counter. Packets of powdered laxative are available that are mixed with a smaller volume of water. Pill-based preparations are also available but usually require swallowing 24 pills with a large amount of water.
Refrigerating the solution can make it easier to drink, but do not put ice in the solution since it will melt and you will have to drink even more fluid. Drinking the solution through a straw, adding sugar-free powdered flavor packets (eg, Crystal Light), and taking half the preparation the night before and the other half later (four to six hours before your colonoscopy) may also make it easier to drink. Drinking this solution may be the most unpleasant part of the exam. Watery diarrhea is the desired result. This may occur shortly after drinking the solution or may be delayed for several hours. The end result should be diarrhea that looks like urine. If you become nauseated or vomit while drinking the solution, call your doctor or nurse for instructions. Tips that can help with nausea and vomiting include temporarily stopping drinking the solution, walking around, and resuming drinking at a slower pace.
Medicines — You can take most prescription and nonprescription medicines right up to the day of the colonoscopy. Your doctor should tell you what medicines to stop. If you are taking certain medications for diabetes or obesity, these may need to be temporarily stopped before the procedure. Examples include glucagon like peptide (GLP)-1 agonists like dulaglutide (brand name: Trulicity) and sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT)-2 inhibitors like empagliflozin (brand name: Jardiance). Please ask your doctor what to do with these medications before your colonoscopy. You should also tell the doctor if you are allergic to any medicines.
Some medicines increase the risk of heavy bleeding if you have a polyp removed during the colonoscopy. Ask your doctor how and when to stop these medicines, including warfarin (brand name: Jantoven), clopidogrel (brand name: Plavix), or any other antithrombotic (“blood thinner”) medicine. Do not stop these medications without first talking with your doctor.
Transportation home — Most patients are given a sedative (a medicine to help you relax) during the colonoscopy, so you will need someone to take you home after your test. An anesthesiologist may give the sedative and monitor you during the colonoscopy. Although you will be awake by the time you go home, the sedative/anesthetic medicines cause changes in reflexes and judgment that can interfere with your ability to make decisions, similar to the effect of alcohol. You will not be able to drive home or go back to work immediately after the procedure if you received sedation for the procedure. You should be able to return to work the next day.
WHAT TO EXPECT
Before the test, a doctor will review the procedure with you, including possible complications, and ask you to sign a consent form.
An IV line will be inserted in your hand or arm. Your blood pressure, heart rate, and breathing will be monitored during the test.
THE COLONOSCOPY PROCEDURE
You will be given fluid and medicines through the IV line. With sedation/analgesia provided during the colonoscopy, many people sleep during the test, while others are very relaxed, comfortable, and generally not aware. Your doctor may request an anesthesiologist give you an anesthetic agent (for example, propofol), which is a stronger sedative and will put you to sleep while you are being closely monitored.
The colonoscope is a long black flexible tube, approximately the diameter of the index finger. The doctor will gently pump air or carbon dioxide and sterile water or saline through the scope into the colon to inflate it and allow the doctor to see the entire lining. You might feel bloating or gas cramps as the air opens the colon. Try not to be embarrassed about passing this gas (it is just air), and let your doctor know if you are uncomfortable. You may feel like you have to go to the bathroom, which is a normal feeling during the procedure.
During the procedure, the doctor might take a biopsy (small pieces of tissue) or remove polyps. Polyps are growths of tissue that can range in size from the tip of a pen to several inches. Most polyps are benign (not cancerous). However, some polyps can become cancerous if allowed to grow for a long time. Having a polyp removed does not hurt. (See "Patient education: Colon polyps (Beyond the Basics)" and "Endoscopic removal of large colon polyps".)
RECOVERY FROM COLONOSCOPY
After the colonoscopy, you will be observed in a recovery area, usually for about 30 to 60 minutes until the effects of the sedative medication wear off. The most common complaint after colonoscopy is a feeling of bloating and gas cramps. You should pass gas and not feel embarrassed doing this either during or after the procedure. This will relieve your feelings of bloating and cramping. You may also feel groggy from the sedation medications. You should not return to work, drive, or drink alcohol that day. Most people are able to eat normally after the test. Ask your doctor when it is safe to restart aspirin and other blood-thinning medications.
COLONOSCOPY COMPLICATIONS
Colonoscopy is a safe procedure, and complications are rare but can occur:
●
Bleeding can occur from biopsies or the removal of polyps, but it is usually minimal and can be controlled.
●
The colonoscope can cause a tear or hole in the colon. This is a serious problem that sometimes requires surgery to repair, but it does not happen commonly.
●
It is possible to have side effects from the sedative medicines like nausea or vomiting.
●
Although colonoscopy is the best test to examine the colon, it is possible for even the most skilled doctors to miss or overlook an abnormal area in the colon.
You should call your doctor immediately if you have any of the following:
●
Severe abdominal pain (not just gas cramps)
●
A firm, bloated abdomen
●
Vomiting
●
Fever
●
A lot of rectal bleeding or clumps of blood
AFTER COLONOSCOPY
Although many people worry about being uncomfortable during a colonoscopy, most people tolerate it very well and feel fine afterward. It is normal to feel tired afterward. Plan to take it easy and relax the rest of the day.
Your doctor can describe the results of the colonoscopy as soon as it is over. If your doctor took biopsies or removed polyps, you should call for results within two weeks if your doctor has not already contacted you.

INTRODUCTION
Wireless video endoscopy or video capsule endoscopy (VCE) is a noninvasive technology designed primarily to provide diagnostic imaging of the small intestine, an anatomic site that has proven peculiarly difficult to visualize. Limited views of the esophagus, stomach, and cecum may also be acquired by small bowel capsules. Images acquired are of excellent resolution and have an approximately 1:8 magnification, which is higher than that of conventional endoscopes. This magnification allows visualization of individual villi. VCE approaches the concept of physiological endoscopy since the capsule moves passively, does not inflate the bowel, and images most of the small intestinal mucosa. Double-ended wireless video capsules have also been developed for the examination of the colon.
A long-awaited artificial intelligence assistant that speeds up the reading of video capsules has also been FDA approved. In addition, a magnetically controllable capsule has become available, along with a tether for examination of the esophagus and stomach.
This topic will review the use of wireless video capsule endoscopy for evaluation of the esophagus, small bowel, and colon. The general approaches to patients with occult and/or suspected small bowel bleeding are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See "Evaluation of occult gastrointestinal bleeding" and "Evaluation of suspected small bowel bleeding (formerly obscure gastrointestinal bleeding)".)
AVAILABLE CAPSULES
Several small intestinal video capsules are available and FDA approved in the United States (table 1):

INTRODUCTION
Hemorrhoids are normal vascular structures in the anal canal, arising from a channel of arteriovenous connective tissues that drains into the superior and inferior hemorrhoidal veins. The cardinal features of hemorrhoidal disease include bleeding, anal pruritus, prolapse, and pain due to thrombosis. This topic will review the anatomic classification, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of hemorrhoids. The management of hemorrhoids are discussed in detail, separately. (See "Home and office treatment of symptomatic hemorrhoids" and "Surgical treatment of hemorrhoidal disease".)
ANATOMY AND CLASSIFICATION
Hemorrhoids arise from a plexus or cushion of dilated arteriovenous channels and connective tissue. Hemorrhoidal veins are normal anatomic structures located in the submucosal layer in the lower rectum and may be external or internal based upon whether they are below or above the dentate line. Both types of hemorrhoids often coexist. Internal and external hemorrhoids communicate with one another and drain into the internal pudendal veins, and ultimately, the inferior vena cava.
Internal hemorrhoids — Internal hemorrhoids are proximal to or above the dentate line. Internal hemorrhoids arise from the superior hemorrhoidal cushion. Their three primary locations (left lateral, right anterior, and right posterior) correspond to the end branches of the middle and superior hemorrhoidal veins. The overlying columnar epithelium is viscerally innervated; therefore, these hemorrhoids are not sensitive to pain, touch, or temperature. Tissues above the dentate line receive visceral innervation, which is less sensitive to pain and irritation. Internal hemorrhoids are further subclassified into four grades based on the degree of prolapse from the anal canal.
Internal hemorrhoids are graded according to the degree to which they prolapse from the anal canal:
●
Grade I hemorrhoids are visualized on anoscopy and may bulge into the lumen but do not prolapse below the dentate line.

INTRODUCTION
The following cases are meant to illustrate clinical, pathological, and endoscopic findings in patients with a variety of small intestinal and colonic conditions. Detailed discussions on the specific disorders are presented in corresponding topic reviews.
LEIOMYOMA
A 51-year-old woman with no significant past medical history underwent a screening colonoscopy. A sessile 6 mm nonbleeding submucosal nodule with smooth contour was visualized in the rectum (picture 1). Biopsy was successfully performed using cold forceps (picture 2A-B). The colonoscopy was otherwise normal to the cecum. (See "Local treatment for gastrointestinal stromal tumors, leiomyomas, and leiomyosarcomas of the gastrointestinal tract", section on 'Colon and rectum'.)
NEUROFIBROMA
A 44-year-old woman with a family history of colon cancer underwent screening colonoscopy. A single submucosal 5 mm nodule of benign appearance was found in the proximal sigmoid colon (picture 3). Cold forceps biopsies were obtained (picture 4A-C). The colonoscopy was otherwise normal to the cecum. (See "Peripheral nerve tumors" and "Peripheral nerve tumors", section on 'Neurofibroma' and "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1): Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis", section on 'Peripheral neurofibromas'.)
GASTROINTESTINAL NEUROENDOCRINE (CARCINOID) TUMOR
A 50-year-old man underwent a screening colonoscopy and was noted to have a 10 mm submucosal nodule of benign appearance in the rectum (picture 5). The nodule was resected using hot snare technique and was retrieved (picture 6A-B). The colonoscopy was otherwise normal to the cecum. (See "Clinical characteristics of well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors arising in the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts" and "Diagnosis of carcinoid syndrome and tumor localization" and "Staging, treatment, and surveillance of localized well-differentiated gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumors".)
JUVENILE POLYPOSIS
A 37-year-old woman underwent an upper endoscopy and colonoscopy for the evaluation of iron deficiency anemia and guaiac positive stool. The patient denied any medication use and had no significant past medical or family history. An upper endoscopy was normal. The colonoscopy showed multiple pedunculated polyps throughout the colon ranging in size from 5 to 15 mm that were resected (picture 7 and picture 8). (See "Juvenile polyposis syndrome".)

"If a patient asks a medical practitioner for help, the doctor does the best he can. He is not responsible for defects in medical knowledge. If, however, the practitioner initiates screening procedures, he is in a very different situation. He should have conclusive evidence that screening can alter the natural history of disease in a significant proportion of those screened."
Archie Cochrane and Walter Holland, 1971
Most doctors are attracted to medicine because they look forward to curing disease. But all things considered, most people would prefer never to contract a disease in the first place; or, if they cannot avoid an illness, they prefer that it be caught early and stamped out before it causes them any harm. To accomplish this, people without specific complaints undergo interventions to identify and modify risk factors to avoid the onset of disease or to find disease early in its course so that early treatment prevents illness. When these interventions take place in clinical practice, the activity is referred to as preventive care.
Preventive care constitutes a large portion of clinical practice [1]. Clinicians should understand its conceptual basis and content. They should be prepared to answer questions from patients such as, "How much exercise do I need, Doctor?" or "I heard that a study showed antioxidants were not helpful in preventing heart disease. What do you think?" or "There was a newspaper ad for a calcium scan. Do you think I should get one?"

INTRODUCTION
Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic progressive disorder of unknown etiology that is characterized by inflammation, fibrosis, and stricturing of medium and large-size ducts in the intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary tree. The great majority of affected patients have underlying ulcerative colitis; the incidence may be as high as 90 percent when rectal and sigmoid biopsies are routinely obtained [1]. (See "Primary sclerosing cholangitis: Epidemiology and pathogenesis".)
PSC is associated with numerous complications, including cholestasis (with associated problems), dominant stricture formation, cholelithiasis and cholangitis, cholangiocarcinoma, and colon cancer (in patients with concurrent ulcerative colitis) [2,3]. In addition, PSC may follow a progressive course, resulting in portal hypertension and liver failure.
There are two major goals of treatment in PSC:
●
Retardation and reversal of the disease process
●
Management of progressive disease and its complications

INTRODUCTION
The following cases are meant to illustrate clinical, pathological, and endoscopic findings in patients with a variety of gastric conditions. Detailed discussions on the specific disorders are presented on corresponding topic reviews.
CARCINOID
A 70-year-old man underwent an upper endoscopy for the evaluation of a two day history of melena and new onset dizziness. The patient's only medical problem is rheumatoid arthritis treated with ibuprofen over the past three years. His weight has been stable and he denies having fevers, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or hematochezia. An upper endoscopy revealed the following (picture 1 and picture 2). (See "Clinical characteristics of well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors arising in the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts".)
B CELL LYMPHOMA
A 45-year-old man with no significant past medical history underwent an upper endoscopy and colonoscopy for the evaluation of iron deficiency anemia and nonspecific abdominal pain. The endoscopy revealed a single 2 cm by 3 cm ulcerated lesion of malignant appearance in the stomach body (picture 3 and picture 4). The colonoscopy was normal to the terminal ileum. (See "Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of diffuse large B cell lymphoma".)
FUNDIC GLAND POLYP
A 52-year-old woman underwent an upper endoscopy for the evaluation of persistent acid reflux and epigastric abdominal discomfort. The patient's only medical condition is gastroesophageal reflux disease for which she takes a proton pump inhibitor. Endoscopy revealed a small polyp in the gastric fundus (picture 5 and picture 6). (See "Gastric polyps".)
XANTHOMA
A 56-year-old male underwent an upper endoscopy for the evaluation of worsening heartburn and nausea. Upper endoscopy revealed two small 4 mm yellow nodules in the fundus (picture 7 and picture 8); the esophagus and duodenum were normal.

INTRODUCTION
Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) refers to administration of stool bacteria into the intestinal tract of a patient with Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) [1-4]. FMT protocols vary between institutions, and comparative efficacy studies are few and underpowered.
Available data are strongest for use of FMT in the setting of recurrent CDI; recurrent CDI is defined by complete abatement of CDI symptoms while on appropriate therapy, followed by reappearance of symptoms within two to eight weeks after treatment has been stopped [2]. Recurrent CDI occurs in 10 to 25 percent of patients treated with antimicrobial therapy.
Data on additional circumstances in which FMT may be beneficial, such as severe and fulminant CDI, are limited and are discussed elsewhere. (See "Clostridioides difficile infection in adults: Treatment and prevention".)
Issues related to FMT are reviewed here. Other issues related to CDI are discussed separately. (See "Clostridioides difficile infection in adults: Epidemiology, microbiology, and pathophysiology" and "Clostridioides difficile infection in adults: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis" and "Clostridioides difficile infection in adults: Treatment and prevention".)
RATIONALE
The gastrointestinal tract harbors a highly complex community of microorganisms that exist in symbiosis with the host. The human gut microbiota is estimated to consist of at least 1014 bacteria and as many as 1000 to 1200 bacterial species, most of which reside in the colon [5].

Balantidium coli is the largest protozoan and the only ciliate parasite that infects humans [1].
EPIDEMIOLOGY
Human balantidiasis occurs worldwide; it is most prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions, including Latin America, the Philippines, Papua New Guinea, and the Middle East. B. coli generally occurs among domestic and wild mammals, especially among pigs in warmer climates and monkeys in the tropics. Infection in humans is therefore also more common in pig farmers and pig-raising regions, especially in settings where hygiene is poor [2,3]. Camels, cattle, donkey, sheep, and goat may also be reservoirs for human infection [4]. Animal fecal contamination of water or food consumed by humans is the principal means for acquisition of infection by humans [5-7]. Transmission between humans can occur via the fecal-oral route.
Transmission of balantidiasis occurs via ingestion of cysts (figure 1). Following ingestion, excystation occurs in the small intestine, and the trophozoites colonize the large intestine. The trophozoites reside in the lumen of the large intestine of humans and animals, where they replicate by binary fission; conjugation may also occur. Trophozoites undergo encystation to produce infective cysts. Some trophozoites invade the wall of the colon and multiply; some return to the lumen and disintegrate. Mature cysts are passed in the stool and can remain viable for up to two weeks in the environment [8]. Cysts are considered the main infective stage; trophozoites can also be passed in stool but generally disappear soon after passage [4].
CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS
Three forms of B. coli infection can occur: asymptomatic cyst excretion, acute colitis, and chronic infection [9-11]. Most cases are asymptomatic; patients with comorbidities (particularly immunosuppression) or other infections are at increased risk for developing symptomatic infection [12-14].
In sporadic cases with acute clinical manifestations, symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss, and abdominal pain. Stools may be either watery or dysenteric [10]. Fulminant disease is rare and is most frequently associated with fulminating dysentery with or without multiple intestinal perforations. When present, the colonic ulcers and clinical presentation are similar to those found in amebic dysentery with deep invasion of the submucosa with organisms. Microperforations with resulting sepsis can be a potentially fatal complication.

INTRODUCTION
Hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC) is an inherited form of diffuse-type gastric cancer (DGC), a highly invasive tumor that is characterized by late presentation and a poor prognosis. HDGC is defined by the presence of a pathogenic germline variant in the cadherin 1 (CDH1) or alpha-1 catenin (also known as alpha-E-catenin; CTNNA1) gene in either an isolated individual with DGC, or in a family with one or more DGC cases in first-degree or second-degree relatives [1]. Lobular breast cancer and nonsyndromic cleft lip/palate are also part of the HDGC syndrome. The term hereditary lobular breast cancer (HLBC) has been proposed as the presence of a pathogenic germline CDH1 variant in either an isolated individual with LBC, or a family with one or more LBC cases in first-degree or second-degree relatives, but no known DGC in either situation.
These pathogenic variants are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. The lifetime risk of gastric cancer in individuals from families with pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in CDH1 is very high, and diagnosis has been made in individuals in their teens and early 20s. As a result, prophylactic total gastrectomy (PTG) is usually advised, generally between ages 20 and 30. Recommendations are less clear for those with pathogenic or likely pathogenic CTNNA1 variants, as penetrance is uncertain.
This topic will provide a detailed overview of HDGC, focusing on the identification of high-risk families and genetic counseling and testing. The pathology and molecular pathogenesis of this disorder and technical aspects of PTG for patients with HDGC are presented separately. (See "Gastric cancer: Pathology and molecular pathogenesis" and "Surgical management of hereditary diffuse gastric cancer".)
MOLECULAR GENETICS
HDGC is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait with high penetrance. The pathogenic germline variants occur in one of two genes, CDH1 and CTNNA1.
CDH1 — Germline truncating pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants of the cadherin 1 (CDH1) gene, located on chromosome 16q22.1, were originally described in three Maori families from New Zealand that were predisposed to DGC. Subsequently, germline CDH1 pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants have been identified in approximately 15 to 50 percent of affected kindreds that meet the historic clinical criteria for HDGC, initially defined by the International Gastric Cancer Linkage Consortium (IGCLC) [2].

INTRODUCTION
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) gastrointestinal disease is an uncommon but serious complication of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Prior to the availability of potent antiretroviral therapy (ART), CMV gastrointestinal disease occurred in up to 5 percent of patients with AIDS, primarily in those with advanced immunosuppression. However, the incidence of CMV gastrointestinal disease has decreased substantially since ART became available [1,2]. (See "Selecting antiretroviral regimens for treatment-naïve persons with HIV-1: General approach".)
A discussion of the pathogenesis and clinical manifestations of other CMV-related diseases in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is found elsewhere. (See "AIDS-related cytomegalovirus neurologic disease" and "Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of AIDS-related cytomegalovirus retinitis".)
NATURAL HISTORY
In persons with prior CMV infection and a CD4 cell count <50 cells/microL, reactivation of latent virus causes a systemic disease that is characterized by intermittent or constant viremia which can lead to colonization or localized infections in one or multiple target organs, including the gastrointestinal tract [3]. CMV gastrointestinal disease was first reported as a manifestation of AIDS in 1983. In early case series, patients generally died within several months without CMV-specific treatment, and hemorrhage or perforation often complicated the course of disease. The prognosis of such patients remained poor despite the advent of antiviral drugs for the treatment of CMV. As an example, the median survival was reported to be four months after the diagnosis of CMV colitis and eight months after CMV esophagitis, even with ganciclovir therapy [4-6]. However, as with all HIV-related opportunistic infections, the prognosis has improved markedly with the utilization of antiretroviral therapy (ART). (See 'Impact of ART' below.)
Risk factors — Most cases of CMV disease occur in the setting of advanced immunosuppression, with CD4 cell counts < 50 cells/microL [7]. The presence of CMV in blood (as measured by culture, CMV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) amplification, or antigen detection) is also a risk factor for the development of invasive disease [8]. However, patients with viremia may not have invasive disease. (See 'Viral detection' below.)
Impact of ART — The prognosis of patients with AIDS and CMV gastrointestinal disease has improved dramatically since effective ART became available in the late 1990s [9,10]. Most cases of end organ disease now occur in patients who are not receiving ART, either due to late diagnosis of HIV disease or poor adherence to prescribed therapy.

INTRODUCTION
Bowel obstruction occurs when the normal flow of intraluminal contents is interrupted. The small bowel is involved in approximately 80 percent of cases of mechanical intestinal obstruction [1,2].
Mechanical small bowel obstruction is caused by intraluminal or extraluminal mechanical compression. In developed countries, adhesion is the most common cause, followed by hernias, malignancies, and various other infectious and inflammatory disorders. (See 'Etiologies' below.)
The etiologies, clinical manifestations, and diagnostic evaluation of mechanical small bowel obstruction will be reviewed here.
The treatment of small bowel obstruction is reviewed elsewhere. (See "Management of small bowel obstruction in adults" and "Palliative care of bowel obstruction in cancer patients".)
Functional small bowel disorders are reviewed elsewhere. (See 'Differential diagnosis' below and "Chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction: Etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis" and "Postoperative ileus".)

INTRODUCTION
Gardner, in the early 1950s, described a kindred with intestinal characteristics of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), but also with a number of extracolonic growths, including osteomas, epidermal cysts and fibromas [1,2]. Dental abnormalities, desmoid tumors, and other lesions were later recognized as additional manifestations of the underlying genetic defect [3,4]. The constellation of inherited colonic adenomatosis together with these extracolonic lesions has become known as Gardner syndrome (GS).
This topic review will discuss each of the extraintestinal manifestations of FAP that historically have defined GS. Gastric, duodenal, and colonic polyp and cancer issues are discussed in a separate section on FAP. Genetic testing is now also available for FAP and GS since both arise from mutations of the same gene [5]. It should be noted that GS is now considered a subcategory of FAP, characterized by the extraintestinal manifestations to be reviewed below that occur in addition to the intestinal polyposis of FAP. Issues related to genetic testing are also presented in the section on FAP. (See "Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of familial adenomatous polyposis" and "Familial adenomatous polyposis: Screening and management of patients and families".)
DEFINITIONS
Shortly after discovery of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene, the gene responsible for familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), it became apparent that both FAP and Gardner syndrome (GS) arose from APC mutations [3,4]. FAP is characterized by hundreds to thousands of colonic adenomatous polyps that most often emerge in the second and third decades of life. Colon cancer is inevitable if the colon is not removed. Polyposis is also usually observed in the stomach, duodenum, and small bowel, although the cancer risk in these locations is far less than in the colon. Inheritance is autosomal dominant with near complete penetrance of the gastrointestinal phenotype but with variable penetrance of the extraintestinal manifestations of the disease [6]. The APC protein is a complex scaffolding protein (brings together two or more proteins) with multiple domains relating to cell migration, cell adhesion, cell proliferation, cell differentiation, and microtubule binding that is involved in chromosomal segregation and mitotic progression. These multiple functional relationships contribute to the many intestinal and extra-intestinal manifestations of FAP/GS [7].
GS cannot be separated from FAP when considering studies that describe its overall prevalence. Estimates for the prevalence of the combined syndromes vary from 1 in 6850 to 1 in 31,250 people (2.29 to 3.2 cases per 100,000 persons) [8-10]. Prevalence appears fairly constant throughout the world with males and females affected equally. Twenty to 30 percent of newly diagnosed cases, ie, those not belonging to previously identified families, appear to represent new mutations [8]. New cases may also arise from mosaic inheritance, which implies that a mutation occurred in parent's sperm or egg cells, but not in other cells of the body, so the parent did not have clinical disease [11,12].
It was once believed that GS patients exhibited fewer and more distinct colonic polyps. However, continued study has demonstrated that the gastrointestinal polyp and cancer phenotypes, although variable, are identical for both GS and FAP. Colonic polyp number depends to some degree on where the mutation occurs in the APC gene [13]. Mutations in the center of the gene (often called the mutation cluster region) give rise to dense polyposis, with 5000 or more colonic polyps [14] when the disease is fully developed. If mutations occur proximal or distal to this central gene location, colonic polyps average approximately 1000 with full expression. Mutations in the extreme proximal or distal locations of the APC gene, or in certain areas of exon nine, are associated with many fewer polyps (often less than 100). This clinical variation is referred to as attenuated FAP. Extraintestinal growths also occur in the attenuated form of FAP, do not correlate with polyp density but have some correlation with mutation location [3,14,15].

INTRODUCTION
A variety of gastrointestinal complaints, such as belching, bloating, abdominal pain, and flatulence, are commonly attributed by the patient to "excess gas," even though this perception is usually incorrect. When excessive intestinal gas does occur, it may be due to excessive air swallowing, increased intraluminal production from malabsorbed nutrients, decreased gas absorption due to obstruction or dysfunctional gas clearance, or expansion of intraluminal gas due to changes in atmospheric pressure. This topic will review the evaluation and management of patients with predominant symptoms of belching, flatulence, abdominal bloating, and distension. Other functional gastrointestinal disorders associated with these symptoms are discussed in detail separately. (See "Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome in adults" and "Functional dyspepsia in adults" and "Etiology and evaluation of chronic constipation in adults", section on 'Etiology and pathogenesis'.)
PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Volume and composition of intestinal gas — The understanding of intestinal gas syndromes has been aided by studies of intestinal gas composition and volume in asymptomatic individuals and in those with complaints of intestinal gas. The volume of gas in the intestinal tract is approximately 200 mL in both the fasting and postprandial states in both normal subjects and individuals who complain of gaseous distension [1-4]. Nitrogen (N2), oxygen (O2), carbon dioxide (CO2), hydrogen (H2), and methane (CH4) account for more than 99 percent of expelled intestinal gas [1]. The composition of gas within the intestinal tract is predominantly N2 [1]. Oxygen is present in very low concentrations, and the concentrations of CO2, H2, and CH4 vary among individuals.
The composition of gas also varies within sections of the gastrointestinal tract. As an example, stomach gas contains high concentrations of N2 and O2 similar to the atmosphere, while flatus contains less O2 and more CH4. None of the principal gases has an odor. Minor constituents of flatus, to which odor may be attributable, include sulfur-containing compounds such as methanethiol, dimethyl sulfide, hydrogen sulfide, as well as short-chain fatty acids, skatoles, indoles, volatile amines, and ammonia [5,6].
Sources of intestinal gas
Air swallowing — Air swallowing (aerophagia) is the major source of stomach gas. Several milliliters of air are ingested in each normal swallow and with gum chewing and smoking. Larger amounts are swallowed when food is gulped. Aerophagia is also a manifestation of anxiety. Most swallowed air appears to be eructated [7].
Swallowed air is the major source of O2 and N2 in intestinal gas. Posture may influence the amount of swallowed air passing from the stomach into the small intestine. The supine position causes gastric air to pass preferentially into the small intestine as gastric air is located above liquid gastric contents that overlie the gastroesophageal junction.

INTRODUCTION
Gastrointestinal endoscopy is a commonly performed diagnostic and/or therapeutic procedure, while endoscopy-related transmission of infection occurs very rarely. However, duodenoscopes have been implicated in transmission of multidrug-resistant organisms, resulting in evolving strategies for endoscope reprocessing and general infection control. This topic will review risk factors for infections transmitted by endoscopy and preventive measures, including a general overview of endoscope reprocessing. For specific reprocessing instructions, we rely on technical standards developed by national and local regulatory agencies, professional societies, and the manufacturers of endoscopes and reprocessing equipment [1-4].
Specific endoscopic procedures are discussed separately:
●
(See "Overview of upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (esophagogastroduodenoscopy)".)
●
(See "Overview of colonoscopy in adults".)
●
(See "Overview of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in adults".)

INTRODUCTION
Diverticular disease of the colon is an important cause of hospital admissions and a significant contributor to health care costs in Western and industrialized societies [1,2]. In the United States, acute diverticulitis is the third most common gastrointestinal illness that requires hospitalization and the leading indication for elective colon resection [3,4].
The triage and inpatient management of patients with acute colonic diverticulitis is discussed in this topic. The discussion pertains mostly to the treatment of sigmoid diverticulitis; a brief discussion of diverticulitis of the right colon can be found at the end of the topic (see 'Right-sided (cecal) diverticulitis' below). Outpatient management and follow-up is the focus of another topic. (See "Acute colonic diverticulitis: Outpatient management and follow-up".)
The epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, complications, and surgical treatment of diverticulitis are discussed elsewhere:

(See "Colonic diverticulosis and diverticular disease: Epidemiology, risk factors, and pathogenesis".)
●
(See "Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of acute colonic diverticulitis in adults".)

INTRODUCTION
Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), also known as checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy, are immunomodulatory antibodies that are used to enhance the immune system. These agents have substantially improved the prognosis for patients with many advanced malignancies.
The primary targets for checkpoint inhibition include (table 1):
●
Programmed cell death receptor 1 and programmed cell death ligand 1 – Multiple antibodies against programmed cell death receptor 1 (PD-1) and programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or are in development and have shown great promise in multiple malignancies. Nivolumab, pembrolizumab, cemiplimab, dostarlimab, retifanlimab, toripalimab, and tislelizumab, all of which target PD-1, and atezolizumab, avelumab, and durvalumab, all of which target PD-L1, have been approved for various indications.
●
Cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 – Ipilimumab and tremelimumab, anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) antibodies, are approved by the FDA, with others in development.
Despite important clinical benefits, ICIs are associated with a unique spectrum of side effects known as immune-related adverse events (irAEs) [1,2]. IrAEs include dermatologic, gastrointestinal, hepatic, endocrine, and other less common inflammatory events. IrAEs are believed to arise from general immunologic enhancement, and temporary immunosuppression with glucocorticoids, tumor necrosis factor-alpha antagonists, mycophenolate mofetil, or other agents can be an effective treatment in most cases. Although rare, fulminant and even fatal toxicities may occur with ICIs [3,4]. Therefore, prompt recognition and management of irAEs is important.

INTRODUCTION
Colon resection is needed to manage a variety of malignant and benign colon lesions, including trauma. Planning colon resection needs to take into account the nature of the lesion and its location within the colon.
The general issues surrounding resecting the colon are reviewed here. Techniques for colon resection are reviewed separately. (See "Right and extended right colectomy: Open technique" and "Left colectomy: Open technique" and "Minimally invasive techniques: Left/sigmoid colectomy and proctectomy" and "Right and extended right colectomy: Minimally invasive techniques".)
INDICATIONS FOR COLON RESECTION
The indications for colon resection include benign and malignant conditions.
Malignancy
●
Malignant and premalignant colon lesions (see "Surgical resection of primary colon cancer")
●
Appendiceal cancer (see "Epithelial tumors of the appendix", section on 'Adenocarcinoma')

INTRODUCTION
Ulcerative colitis is characterized by recurring episodes of inflammation limited to the mucosal layer of the colon. It commonly involves the rectum and may extend in a proximal and continuous fashion to involve other parts of the colon.
This topic will review the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and natural history of ulcerative colitis. The definition, epidemiology, pathogenesis, and treatment of ulcerative colitis are discussed in detail, separately. (See "Definitions, epidemiology, and risk factors for inflammatory bowel disease" and "Medical management of low-risk adult patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis" and "Management of the hospitalized adult patient with severe ulcerative colitis" and "Management of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis in adults".)
CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS
Colitis — Patients with ulcerative colitis usually present with diarrhea, which may be associated with blood. Bowel movements are frequent and small in volume as a result of rectal inflammation. Associated symptoms include colicky abdominal pain, urgency, tenesmus, and incontinence [1]. Patients with mainly distal disease may have constipation accompanied by frequent discharge of blood and mucus.
The onset of symptoms is usually gradual, and symptoms are progressive over several weeks. Symptoms may be preceded by a self-limited episode of rectal bleeding that occurred weeks or months earlier.
The severity of symptoms may range from mild disease with four or fewer stools per day with or without blood to severe disease with more than 10 stools per day with severe cramps and continuous bleeding [1]. (See 'Disease severity' below.)

INTRODUCTION
Cystic neoplasms of the pancreas include serous cystic tumors, mucinous cystic neoplasms, solid pseudopapillary neoplasms, cystic islet cell tumors, and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas (IPMNs) [1-3]. IPMNs have also been referred to as mucinous duct ectasias and intraductal papillary mucinous tumors. IPMNs are potentially malignant intraductal epithelial neoplasms that are grossly visible (>1 cm) and are composed of mucin-producing columnar cells. The lesions show papillary proliferation, cyst formation, and varying degrees of cellular atypia [4,5]. IPMNs may involve the main pancreatic duct, the branch ducts, or both. (See "Classification of pancreatic cysts".)
This topic will review the pathophysiology and clinical manifestations of IPMNs. The diagnosis and treatment of IPMNs, as well as an overview of pancreatic cystic neoplasms, are presented separately. (See "Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm of the pancreas (IPMN): Evaluation and management" and "Classification of pancreatic cysts" and "Pancreatic cystic neoplasms: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management".)
EPIDEMIOLOGY
Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm of the pancreas (IPMN) was first described in 1982 when four patients with pancreatic carcinoma and favorable outcomes were reported. The patients were noted to have dilated main pancreatic ducts, patulous ampullary orifices, and mucus secretion from the pancreatic duct. With time, the incidence of IPMN has increased, largely due to increased diagnosis [6]. Prior to 1999, the distinction between IPMN and mucinous cystic neoplasm had not been clarified, so many lesions previously classified as MCNs may have, in fact, been IPMNs. In addition, improvements in imaging technology have led to more accurate identification of cystic pancreatic lesions.
The true incidence of IPMN is not known because many IPMNs are small and asymptomatic. A series of 2832 consecutive computed tomography scans performed in adults without a history of pancreatic lesions or factors predisposing to pancreatic disease found pancreatic cysts in 73 (2.6 percent) [7]. In a similar study of 616 consecutive patients undergoing magnetic resonance imaging, the incidence of pancreatic cysts was higher (13.5 percent), with a median diameter of 6 mm [8]. Many of these were likely IPMNs since it is thought that IPMNs account for 1 to 3 percent of exocrine pancreatic neoplasms and 20 to 50 percent of cystic pancreatic neoplasms [9-11].
The male-to-female ratio for main duct IPMN has varied in reports from 1.1 to 3:1, and for branch duct IPMN it has varied from 0.7 to 1.8:1 [12]. The ratio varies geographically, with a male predominance in Japan and Korea and a more even distribution or female predominance in the United States and Europe. The typical age at presentation is in the fifth to seventh decade [13] (table 1).

INTRODUCTION
The profile of aging in the United States has changed dramatically over the last century. The average life expectancy at birth has increased from 47 years in 1900 to nearly 79 years in 2014. By 2030, the percentage of the population over 65 years of age will exceed 20 percent, or over 70 million people [1]. Worldwide, the number of adults over 60 years of age will top 2 billion by 2050 and will constitute over 20 percent of the world's population [2].
Definitions of health and wellbeing in late life have changed with the increase in life expectancy. Heart disease, cancer, and stroke have become the leading causes of death among older adults, while deaths due to infection have decreased. Adults surviving into late life suffer from high rates of chronic illness; 80 percent have at least one and 50 percent have at least two chronic conditions [1]. There is a strong association between the presence of geriatric syndromes (cognitive impairment, falls, incontinence, vision or hearing impairment, low body mass index, dizziness) and dependency in activities of daily living [3].
Decline in function and loss of independence are not an inevitable consequence of aging. Given the high prevalence and impact of chronic health problems among older patients, evidence-based interventions to address these problems become increasingly important to maximize both the quantity and quality of life for older adults.
This topic offers a brief discussion of office-based assessments to identify and address common problems that are amenable to prevention or amelioration in older adults. It also provides descriptions and tools useful in performing the assessments contained in the Medicare Initial Preventive Physical Examination (IPPE). (See 'Medicare and preventive visits' below.)
An overview of preventive medicine for the general population is presented separately. (See "Overview of preventive care in adults".)

INTRODUCTION
The safety of colorectal surgery, as performed in patients with colorectal cancer and inflammatory bowel disease, has improved dramatically over the last 50 years due to improvements in preoperative preparation, antibiotic prophylaxis, surgical technique, and postoperative management [1]. Nevertheless, complications such as those related to colorectal anastomoses continue to occur. (See "Overview of the management of primary colon cancer" and "Surgical treatment of rectal cancer" and "Surgical management of ulcerative colitis".)
The risks, management, and outcomes of anastomotic complications of colorectal surgery will be reviewed here. These complications include bleeding, dehiscence and leakage, strictures, and fistulas [2]. The risks, management, and outcomes of intra-abdominal, pelvic, and genitourinary complications following colorectal surgery are reviewed elsewhere. (See "Management of intra-abdominal, pelvic, and genitourinary complications of colorectal surgery".)
MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY RISK FACTORS
Colorectal surgery is associated with appreciable morbidity and mortality. Prospective studies, both multicenter and single center, have evaluated patient outcomes after colorectal surgery [3-9]. The rate of major morbidity ranged from 20 to 35 percent [4,7], and the 30 day mortality rate ranged from 2 to 9 percent [4-9]. There does not appear to be a significant difference in 30 day mortality rate between malignant versus benign indications for surgery [4,7,9].
Independent preoperative risk factors that are associated with an increased risk of in-hospital complications include [4,7]:

INTRODUCTION
Anorectal complaints are common: hemorrhoid-related complaints account for more than two million outpatient evaluations annually [1,2], and the incidence of anal fissure is estimated to be 1.1 cases per 1000 person-years [3]. It is, therefore, highly likely that clinicians will encounter these conditions.
As added challenges, many anorectal diagnoses share similar symptoms, and benign anorectal conditions share common symptoms with cancers of the anus and rectum. As such, a thorough evaluation is critical toward making the correct diagnosis.
This topic describes how to perform a thorough history and physical examination for adult patients presenting with various anorectal complaints, followed by key points to consider depending upon the patient's chief complaint (eg, pain, bleeding).
Specific anorectal diseases are discussed in other UpToDate topics referenced below.
PATIENT HISTORY
The clinician should first elicit a history of anorectal bleeding, anorectal or perianal pain, perianal drainage, anal pruritus, or the prolapse of tissue through the anal orifice. The patient response will help direct the subsequent evaluation. (See 'Symptom-based differential diagnosis' below.)

INTRODUCTION
This monograph summarizes the interpretation of germline genetic testing of COL3A1, the gene associated with vascular type Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (vascular EDS [VEDS], previously called EDS type IV) [1]. Affected individuals are heterozygous for a pathogenic variant in COL3A1.
Evaluation and management of VEDS are discussed in detail separately. (See 'Resources' below.)
Clinical characteristics of VEDS — There are 13 different types of EDS with different genetic causes and different clinical characteristics (table 1). (See "Ehlers-Danlos syndromes: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis", section on 'Classification'.)
Neonates may present with clubfoot, hip dislocation, and/or amniotic bands [2]. Unless identified as part of a family study or known family history of the condition, presentation in most individuals who are unaware of their diagnosis occurs in early adulthood (late 20s to early 30s) with a major complication, with a small proportion presenting in childhood [3,4].
Presenting findings can be catastrophic, including sudden death, shock, stroke, acute abdomen due to intestinal perforation or rupture, or uterine rupture during delivery. There is a 5 percent risk of maternal death during pregnancy, although pregnancy does not appear to affect overall survival in VEDS [5]. This risk estimate is probably biased by ascertainment at the time of complications or death in the largest series.

CASE
A 72-year-old man returns to see you in your office following a recent hospital admission for gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. The patient is treated with warfarin and clopidogrel for cardiac indications. He has had recurrent GI bleeding requiring intermittent blood transfusions for approximately six months. The site of the bleeding has eluded diagnosis despite upper GI endoscopy, colonoscopy, and capsule enteroscopy. The patient has had type 2 diabetes for 23 years and has been on insulin for 11 years. His diabetes is complicated by retinopathy, peripheral neuropathy, and chronic kidney disease. The patient has rheumatic heart disease, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. He has had mitral and aortic valve replacements and recent placement of a stent in the left anterior descending artery. The estimated left ventricular ejection fraction is 26 percent. On the day of discharge from the hospital, the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) was 66 mg/dL, creatinine 2.2 mg/dL, international normalized ratio (INR) 2.4, and glycated hemoglobin (A1C) 5.40 percent. His medications include NPH insulin 58 units every morning and 24 units every day at bedtime. He is also on furosemide 120 mg twice a day, potassium chloride 20 mEq twice a day, spironolactone 50 mg once a day, metolazone 5 mg every other day, esomeprazole 40 mg a day, warfarin 4 mg a day, and clopidogrel 75 mg a day. He has been eating regularly and checking his blood glucose level at home since discharge. The glucose values before breakfast have been 131 to 152 mg /dL (7.3 to 8.4 mmol/L), and those before supper have been 143 to 197 mg/dL (7.9 to 10.9 mmol/L).
How would you manage the patient's diabetes at this time?
●
Reduce insulin doses by 50 percent because the A1C indicates excessively tight management in this patient, in whom hypoglycemia is of more than the usual concern because of his cardiovascular disease. (See "Interactive diabetes case 7: Management of diabetes in a 72-year-old patient with type 2 diabetes, GI bleeding, and multiple other medical problems – A1".)
●
Stop insulin to avert hypoglycemia in this patient, in whom hypoglycemia is of more than the usual concern because of his cardiovascular disease, and begin glyburide 10 mg before breakfast and 10 mg before supper to provide more gentle control of the diabetes. (See "Interactive diabetes case 7: Management of diabetes in a 72-year-old patient with type 2 diabetes, GI bleeding, and multiple other medical problems – A2".)
●
Stop insulin to avert hypoglycemia in this patient, in whom hypoglycemia is of more than the usual concern because of his cardiovascular disease, and begin metformin 1000 mg before breakfast and supper to manage diabetes without the risk of hypoglycemia. (See "Interactive diabetes case 7: Management of diabetes in a 72-year-old patient with type 2 diabetes, GI bleeding, and multiple other medical problems – A3".)

INTRODUCTION
The TP53 gene encodes the tumor suppressor protein p53, which has been designated the guardian of the genome. It is responsible for much of the modern understanding of tumor suppressor function.
Of all the genes associated with inherited cancer syndromes, TP53 may be the most challenging to address clinically, for reasons discussed below. Other considerations such as somatic TP53 mutations in cancer and indications for testing are discussed separately [1]. (See 'UpToDate topics' below.)
OVERVIEW
How to read the report — Germline TP53 testing has major implications for clinical care. Early involvement of an expert in hereditary cancer syndromes is essential.
The tables define terms used in genetic test reports (table 1) and list general caveats to consider when reviewing results (table 2).
Important caveats specific to TP53 include:

INTRODUCTION
Acute phosphate nephropathy is a form of kidney injury that occurs following the use of bowel purgatives that contain oral sodium phosphate (OSP) and has been reported following the administration of sodium phosphate-containing enemas [1,2]. OSP was formerly sold without prescription under the brand name "Fleet Phospho-soda" (C.B. Fleet Inc). Fleet no longer distributes OSP; however, generic versions of OSP are still available without prescription. OSP is also available by prescription in a pill form (Visicol, OsmoPrep). In both pill and liquid form, OSP is a hyperosmotic laxative that acts by drawing water into the gastrointestinal tract. Although long used as a laxative, OSP began to be used as a purgative for colonoscopy in 1990 [3]. It is frequently given in favor of standard polyethylene glycol (PEG)-based lavage solutions because of the smaller required volume, which results in better patient compliance and improved colonic cleansing [4-6].
However, there have been multiple cases of OSP-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) with defining histologic features on biopsy [7-11]. This clinicopathologic entity has been referred to as acute phosphate nephropathy.
In 2006, in response to published reports, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a warning regarding the potential for AKI in patients who received OSP [12]. The warning was incorporated into a consensus document on bowel preparation by the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons (ASCRS), the American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE), and the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES) [13]. In December 2008, the FDA required that a boxed warning be added to labeling of Visicol and OsmoPrep, which are still available by prescription [14]. At the same time, following the recommendation of the FDA, over-the-counter preparations that contain OSP were voluntarily withdrawn from the market by Fleet; but, as noted above, generic versions are still available. In 2014, the FDA issued another warning that using more than one dose in 24 hours of OSP to treat constipation can cause "rare but serious harm to the kidneys and heart, and even death" [15].
This topic provides a review of the clinical features of acute phosphate nephropathy. AKI associated with an increased phosphate load has also been described in tumor lysis syndrome, especially with alkalinization of the urine by bicarbonate-containing intravenous (IV) fluids. Tumor lysis syndrome is discussed elsewhere. (See "Tumor lysis syndrome: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, definition, etiology and risk factors".)
PATHOGENESIS
The mechanism underlying acute phosphate nephropathy most likely relates to a transient but potentially severe increase in serum phosphate coupled with volume depletion, both of which may occur following the administration of bowel purgatives that contain oral sodium phosphate (OSP).

INTRODUCTION
Itching of the anus or perianal skin is a common disorder usually arising from benign conditions. It may be transient or chronic and difficult to treat. This topic will review the etiology, diagnostic approach, and management of patients with anal pruritus.
EPIDEMIOLOGY
Anal pruritus is estimated to affect 1 to 5 percent of the general population [1]. However, most of these patients probably do not come to medical attention. Anal pruritus is more common in the fourth to sixth decades of life and has a higher prevalence in males [2].
ETIOLOGY
Approximately 75 percent of cases of anal pruritus are secondary to inflammatory, infectious, systemic, neoplastic, and anorectal disorders that contribute to or underlie the development of pruritus [2,3]. Idiopathic anal pruritus likely results from perianal fecal contamination and resultant trauma from wiping and scratching.
Anorectal diseases — Anorectal diseases associated with anal pruritus include prolapsed internal hemorrhoids, abscesses, fissures, and fistulas (picture 1 and picture 2 and picture 3) [2]. Skin tags do not contribute significantly to anal pruritus [4]. (See "Hemorrhoids: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis", section on 'Clinical manifestations' and "Perianal and perirectal abscess" and "Anal fissure: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, prevention" and "Anorectal fistula: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis", section on 'Clinical features'.)
Dermatologic diseases — Anal pruritus can also result from a variety of inflammatory skin disorders [5].

INTRODUCTION
This monograph summarizes the interpretation of germline testing of the APC gene. It does not discuss indications for testing and is not intended to replace clinical judgment in the decision to test or the care of the tested individual. These subjects are discussed separately [1].
OVERVIEW
How to read the report — An approach to reviewing a genetic test report is summarized in the checklist (table 1).
Testing involves two steps: determining the genotype and interpreting the pathogenicity of the variant(s).
●
Genotype – Identifies variants. Should be repeated in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified laboratory (or other nationally certified laboratory) if the results were obtained by direct-to-consumer testing or a research study and would impact clinical care (eg, positive finding, negative finding in an individual with a suspected cancer syndrome).
●
Interpretation – Determines pathogenicity of the variants identified. May require updating, especially for variants of unknown significance (VUSs). (See "Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of familial adenomatous polyposis", section on 'Genetics'.)

INTRODUCTION
This monograph summarizes the interpretation of germline testing of the POLD1 and POLE genes. It does not discuss indications for testing and is not intended to replace clinical judgment in the decision to test or the care of the tested individual. These subjects are discussed separately [1].
OVERVIEW
How to read the report — The tables provide a checklist for reviewing a genetic test report (table 1) and a glossary of terms that may be used (table 2).
Testing involves two steps: determining the genotype and interpreting the pathogenicity of the variant(s).
●
Genotype – Identifies variation from a reference sequence. If the results were obtained by direct-to-consumer testing or a research study and would impact clinical care, testing should be repeated in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified laboratory or other nationally certified laboratory. This includes a positive finding, regardless of clinical presentation, or a negative finding in an individual with a suspected cancer syndrome or a positive family history of a cancer syndrome.
●
Interpretation – Pathogenicity (ability to cause disease) is determined based on preclinical, clinical, and epidemiologic studies. The table summarizes the five classifications (table 3). A variant of uncertain significance (VUS) is one for which the association with disease is currently unknown; additional study will eventually determine if the variant is pathogenic or benign. Periodic reassessment of available information is appropriate.

INTRODUCTION
The distal small bowel and colon are susceptible to the deleterious effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) [1-5]. The ileocecal region is a potential site for a variety of NSAID-induced injuries including erosions, ulcers, strictures, perforation, and the formation of diaphragms, which can lead to bowel obstruction [6-9]. NSAIDs can also lead to colitis resembling inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), exacerbate pre-existing IBD, or complicate diverticular disease (ie, perforation or bleeding) [10,11]. Older adults and those on long-term NSAID therapy appear to be at highest risk [11]. There may also be an association between NSAID use and collagenous colitis. (See "Microscopic (lymphocytic and collagenous) colitis: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management".)
STUDIES OF NSAID INJURY
A number of studies using different methodologies have evaluated the potential deleterious effects of NSAIDs on the small bowel and colon. Considered together, they suggest that NSAID-related intestinal injury is common. However, the proportion of patients who develop clinically important NSAID-induced enteropathy remains relatively small.
The following summarizes the range of findings:
●
Approximately two-thirds of NSAID users demonstrate intestinal inflammation by indirect methods of 111-Indium-labeled leukocyte scintigraphy and 111-Indium fecal excretion [12].
●
In a case-control study, patients with small or large bowel perforation or bleeding were more than twice as likely to be NSAID users [13].

INTRODUCTION
Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is an advanced endoscopic procedure in which a specialized side-viewing upper endoscope is guided into the duodenum, allowing for instruments to be passed through the ampulla of Vater and into the biliary and pancreatic ducts. The ducts are opacified by injecting a contrast medium, thereby permitting radiographic visualization and therapeutic interventions. ERCP-guided interventions are used for management of a variety of pancreaticobiliary disorders (eg, removal of bile duct stones, relief of biliary obstruction).
ERCP is a complex procedure that requires specialized training and experience, and it is associated with higher rates of serious complications than other endoscopic procedures (eg, upper endoscopy, colonoscopy). It is important to use strategies to prevent ERCP-related complications and to recognize complications early so that treatment can be initiated.
This topic will provide an overview of ERCP including indications, patient preparation, post-procedure care, and complications.
Specific ERCP-guided interventions are discussed separately:

INTRODUCTION
Dermatomyositis (DM) and polymyositis (PM) are idiopathic inflammatory myopathies characterized by proximal skeletal muscle weakness and evidence of muscle inflammation. DM, unlike PM, is characterized by the presence of various cutaneous manifestations. DM and PM may also be associated with inflammatory arthritis, interstitial lung disease, Raynaud phenomenon, and the presence of autoantibodies.
An association between inflammatory myopathy and cancer has been recognized since the report of two cases of PM and gastric cancer in 1916 [1]. The association is stronger for patients with DM than PM. The evidence for an association between cancer and inflammatory myopathy includes:
●
Epidemiologic evidence from large population studies
●
Temporal relationship between the diagnosis of cancer and myopathy
●
The improvement or resolution of myopathy after treatment of the cancer

INTRODUCTION
Injury to the intestines can occur following radiation therapy for cancer. It can affect both the large and small intestines, is often progressive, and may lead to a variety of clinical consequences depending upon the extent of the injury. It usually develops three or more months after radiation therapy. Chronic radiation enteritis is due to an obliterative arteritis that leads to intestinal ischemia, which can result in stricture, ulceration, fibrosis, and occasionally fistula formation. The physiologic consequences can include altered intestinal transit, reduced bile acid absorption, increased intestinal permeability, bacterial overgrowth, and lactose malabsorption. Clinical manifestations include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss, malnutrition, and bleeding (usually in patients with colonic involvement).
This topic review will focus on the diagnosis and management of chronic radiation injury to the small intestine and proximal colon. The pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and risk factors for chronic radiation enteritis and other radiation-related gastrointestinal toxicities are discussed separately. (See "Overview of gastrointestinal toxicity of radiation therapy" and "Radiation proctitis: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management".)
DIAGNOSIS
The diagnosis of chronic radiation enteritis is suspected in patients with nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or lower gastrointestinal bleeding three or more months after completion of radiation therapy. The diagnosis is usually established by segmental bowel inflammation in regions of a known radiation field on imaging or by endoscopy and histology.
Diagnostic approach — Evaluation of a patient with suspected chronic radiation enteritis serves to exclude other causes of etiologies, establish the diagnosis of chronic radiation, and determine the extent of the disease.
●
The patient's prior radiation treatment should be reviewed to determine the cumulative dose, dose per fraction, proximity of sensitive tissues and organs, and other cancer treatments (eg, abdominal surgery, concurrent chemotherapy) that can increase the risk of radiation enteritis. This may help to determine which intestinal segments may have received excessive radiation exposure, which can then be correlated with the radiologic findings and the clinical presentation.
