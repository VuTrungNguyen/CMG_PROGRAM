{"question":"A gastroenterology fellow is interested in the relationship between smoking and incidence of Barrett esophagus.

{"question":"Digestion begins in the mouth by breaking food up into smaller particles through mastication and mixing it with saliva containing amylase. Food then enters the stomach, where gastric acid and pepsin initiate protein digestion.
