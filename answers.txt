    "Answer": "The jejunum is distinguished from the duodenum by several anatomical and histological features. The jejunum has a thicker wall and a larger diameter compared to the duodenum. It also has more prominent plicae circulares (circular folds) and a greater density of villi, which are longer and more finger-like. Additionally, the jejunum lacks Brunner's glands, which are present in the duodenum and secrete alkaline mucus to neutralize gastric acid. The jejunum also has fewer Peyer's patches compared to the ileum, but more than the duodenum.",
